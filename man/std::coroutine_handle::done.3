   constexpr bool done() const noexcept;                                    \fB(2)\fP (since
                                                                                C++20)

   Checks if a suspended coroutine is suspended at its final suspended point.

   1) Returns true if the coroutine to which *this refers is suspended at its final
   suspend point, or false if the coroutine is suspended at other suspend points. The
   behavior is undefined if *this does not refer to a suspended coroutine.
   2) Always returns false.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   1) true if the coroutine is suspended at its final suspend point, false if the
   coroutine is suspended at other suspend points.
   2) false

.SH Notes

   A no-op coroutine is always considered not suspended at its final suspended point.
