.SH Synopsis

   pos_type pubseekpos( pos_type pos,
                        std::ios_base::openmode which = std::ios_base::in |        \fB(1)\fP
   std::ios_base::out );
   protected:

   virtual pos_type seekpos( pos_type pos,                                         \fB(2)\fP

                             std::ios_base::openmode which = std::ios_base::in |
   std::ios_base::out );

   Sets the position indicator of the input and/or output sequence to an absolute
   position.

   1) Calls seekpos(pos, which) of the most derived class.
   2) The base class version of this function has no effect. The derived classes may
   override this function to allow absolute positioning of the position indicator.

.SH Parameters

   pos   - absolute position to set the position indicator to
           defines which of the input and/or output sequences to affect. It can be one
           or a combination of the following constants:
   which -
           Constant Explanation
           in       affect the input sequence
           out      affect the output sequence

.SH Return value

   1) The return value of seekpos(pos, which).
   2) The resulting absolute position as defined by the position indicator. The base
   class version returns pos_type(off_type(-1)).
