.SH NAME
std::basic_string::front \- std::basic_string::front

.SH Synopsis
   CharT& front();             \fB(1)\fP (constexpr since C++20)
   const CharT& front() const; \fB(2)\fP (constexpr since C++20)

   Returns reference to the first character in the string. The behavior is undefined if
   empty() is true.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   Reference to the first character, equivalent to operator[]\fB(0)\fP.

.SH Complexity

   Constant.

.SH Notes

   In libstdc++, front() is not available in C++98 mode.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <string>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::string s("Exemplary");
     char& f1 = s.front();
     f1 = 'e';
     std::cout << s << '\\n'; // "exemplary"
  
     std::string const c("Exemplary");
     char const& f2 = c.front();
     std::cout << &f2 << '\\n'; // "Exemplary"
 }

.SH Output:

 exemplary
 Exemplary
