.SH Synopsis
   shared_ptr& operator=( const shared_ptr& r ) noexcept;    \fB(1)\fP
   template< class Y >                                       \fB(2)\fP

   shared_ptr& operator=( shared_ptr&& r ) noexcept;         \fB(3)\fP
   template< class Y >                                       \fB(4)\fP
   shared_ptr& operator=( shared_ptr<Y>&& r ) noexcept;
   template< class Y >                                       \fB(5)\fP (deprecated in C++11)
   shared_ptr& operator=( std::auto_ptr<Y>&& r );                (removed in C++17)
   template< class Y, class Deleter >                        \fB(6)\fP
   shared_ptr& operator=( std::unique_ptr<Y, Deleter>&& r );

   Replaces the managed object with the one managed by r.

   If *this already owns an object and it is the last shared_ptr owning it, and r is
   not the same as *this, the object is destroyed through the owned deleter.

   1,2) Shares ownership of the object managed by r. If r manages no object, *this
   manages no object too. Equivalent to shared_ptr<T>(r).swap(*this).
   3,4) Move-assigns a shared_ptr from r. After the assignment, *this contains a copy
   of the previous state of r, and r is empty. Equivalent to
   shared_ptr<T>(std::move(r)).swap(*this).
   5) Transfers the ownership of the object managed by r to *this. If r manages no
   object, *this manages no object too. After the assignment, *this contains the
   pointer previously held by r, and use_count() == 1; also r is empty. Equivalent to
   shared_ptr<T>(r).swap(*this).
   6) Transfers the ownership of the object managed by r to *this. The deleter
   associated to r is stored for future deletion of the managed object. r manages no
   object after the call. Equivalent to shared_ptr<T>(std::move(r)).swap(*this).

.SH Parameters

   r - another smart pointer to share the ownership to or acquire the ownership from

.SH Return value

   *this

.SH Notes

   The implementation may meet the requirements without creating a temporary shared_ptr
   object.

.SH Exceptions

   5,6) May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
