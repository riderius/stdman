.TH std::memmove 3 "2024.06.10" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::memmove \- std::memmove

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstring>
   void* memmove( void* dest, const void* src, std::size_t count );

   Copies count characters from the object pointed to by src to the object pointed to
   by dest. Both objects are reinterpreted as arrays of unsigned char.

   The objects may overlap: copying takes place as if the characters were copied to a
   temporary character array and then the characters were copied from the array to
   dest.

   If either dest or src is an invalid or null pointer, the behavior is undefined, even
   if count is zero.

   If the objects are potentially-overlapping or not TriviallyCopyable, the behavior of
   memmove is not specified and may be undefined.

.SH Parameters

   dest  - pointer to the memory location to copy to
   src   - pointer to the memory location to copy from
   count - number of bytes to copy

.SH Return value

   dest

.SH Notes

   std::memmove may be used to implicitly create objects in the destination buffer.

   Despite being specified "as if" a temporary buffer is used, actual implementations
   of this function do not incur the overhead of double copying or extra memory. For
   small count, it may load up and write out registers; for larger blocks, a common
   approach (glibc and bsd libc) is to copy bytes forwards from the beginning of the
   buffer if the destination starts before the source, and backwards from the end
   otherwise, with a fall back to std::memcpy when there is no overlap at all.

   Where strict aliasing prohibits examining the same memory as values of two different
   types, std::memmove may be used to convert the values.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <cstring>
 #include <iostream>
  
 int main()
 {
     char str[] = "1234567890";
     std::cout << str << '\\n';
     std::memmove(str + 4, str + 3, 3); // copies from [4, 5, 6] to [5, 6, 7]
     std::cout << str << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 1234567890
 1234456890
