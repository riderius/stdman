.SH NAME
std::latch::try_wait \- std::latch::try_wait

.SH Synopsis
   bool try_wait() const noexcept;  \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Returns true only if the internal counter has reached zero. This function may
   spuriously return false with very low probability even if the internal counter has
   reached zero.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   With very low probability false, otherwise cnt == 0, where cnt is the value of the
   internal counter.

.SH Notes

   The reason why a spurious result is permitted is to allow implementations to use a
   memory order more relaxed than std::memory_order_seq_cst.
