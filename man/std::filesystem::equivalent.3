.SH NAME
std::filesystem::equivalent \- std::filesystem::equivalent

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <filesystem>
   bool equivalent( const std::filesystem::path& p1,   \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
                    const std::filesystem::path& p2 );
   bool equivalent( const std::filesystem::path& p1,

                    const std::filesystem::path& p2,   \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP

                    std::error_code& ec ) noexcept;

   Checks whether the paths p1 and p2 resolve to the same file system entity.

   If either p1 or p2 does not exist, an error is reported.

   The non-throwing overload returns false on errors.

.SH Parameters

   p1, p2 - paths to check for equivalence
   ec     - out-parameter for error reporting in the non-throwing overload

.SH Return value

   true if the p1 and p2 refer to the same file or directory and their file status is
   the same. false otherwise.

.SH Exceptions

   Any overload not marked noexcept may throw std::bad_alloc if memory allocation
   fails.

   1) Throws std::filesystem::filesystem_error on underlying OS API errors, constructed
   with p1 as the first path argument, p2 as the second path argument, and the OS error
   code as the error code argument.
   2) Sets a std::error_code& parameter to the OS API error code if an OS API call
   fails, and executes ec.clear() if no errors occur.

.SH Notes

   Two paths are considered to resolve to the same file system entity if the two
   candidate entities the paths resolve to are located on the same device at the same
   location. For POSIX, this means that the st_dev and st_ino members of their POSIX
   stat structure, obtained as if by POSIX stat(), are equal.

   In particular, all hard links for the same file or directory are equivalent, and a
   symlink and its target on the same file system are equivalent.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <cstdint>
 #include <filesystem>
 #include <iostream>
 namespace fs = std::filesystem;
  
 int main()
 {
     // hard link equivalency
     fs::path p1 = ".";
     fs::path p2 = fs::current_path();
     if (fs::equivalent(p1, p2))
         std::cout << p1 << " is equivalent to " << p2 << '\\n';
  
     // symlink equivalency
     for (const fs::path lib : {"/lib/libc.so.6", "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6"})
     {
         try
         {
             p2 = lib.parent_path() / fs::read_symlink(lib);
         }
         catch (std::filesystem::filesystem_error const& ex)
         {
             std::cout << ex.what() << '\\n';
             continue;
         }
  
         if (fs::equivalent(lib, p2))
             std::cout << lib << " is equivalent to " << p2 << '\\n';
     }
 }

.SH Possible output:

 "." is equivalent to "/var/tmp/test"
 filesystem error: read_symlink: No such file or directory [/lib/libc.so.6]
 "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6" is equivalent to "/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.23.so"
