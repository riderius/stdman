.SH NAME
std::flat_multiset \- std::flat_multiset

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <flat_set>
   template<

       class Key,
       class Compare = std::less<Key>,        (since C++23)
       class KeyContainer = std::vector<Key>

   > class flat_multiset;

   The flat multiset is a container adaptor that gives the functionality of an
   associative container that stores a sorted set of objects of type Key. Unlike
   std::flat_set, multiple keys with equivalent values are allowed. Sorting is done
   using the key comparison function Compare.

   The class template flat_multiset acts as a wrapper to the underlying sorted
   container passed as object of type KeyContainer.

   Everywhere the standard library uses the Compare requirements, uniqueness is
   determined by using the equivalence relation. Informally, two objects a and b are
   considered equivalent if neither compares less than the other: !comp(a, b) &&
   !comp(b, a).

   std::flat_multiset meets the requirements of Container, ReversibleContainer,
   optional container requirements, and all requirements of AssociativeContainer
   (including logarithmic search complexity), except that:

     * requirements related to nodes are not applicable,
     * iterator invalidation requirements differ,
     * the complexity of insertion and erasure operations is linear.

   A flat multiset supports most AssociativeContainer's operations that use equal keys.

.SH Template parameters

   Key          - The type of the stored elements. The program is ill-formed if Key is
                  not the same type as KeyContainer::value_type.
   Compare      - A Compare type providing a strict weak ordering.
                  The type of the underlying SequenceContainer to store the elements.
                  The iterators of such container should satisfy
   KeyContainer - LegacyRandomAccessIterator or model random_access_iterator.

                  The standard containers std::vector and std::deque satisfy these
                  requirements.

.SH Notes

   The member types iterator and const_iterator may be aliases to the same type. This
   means defining a pair of function overloads using the two types as parameter types
   may violate the One Definition Rule. Since iterator is convertible to
   const_iterator, a single function with a const_iterator as parameter type will work
   instead.
