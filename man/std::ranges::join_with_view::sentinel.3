std::ranges::join_with_view::sentinel \- std::ranges::join_with_view::sentinel

.SH Synopsis
   template< bool Const >  (since C++23)
   class /*sentinel*/      (exposition only*)

   The return type of join_with_view::end when either of the underlying ranges (V or
   ranges::range_reference_t<V>) is not a common_range, or when the parent
   join_with_view is not a forward_range.

   If either V or Pattern is not a simple view, Const is true for sentinels returned
   from the const overloads, and false otherwise. If V and Pattern are simple views,
   Const is true.
