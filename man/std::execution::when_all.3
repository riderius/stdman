.SH NAME
std::execution::when_all \- std::execution::when_all

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <execution>
   execution::sender auto when_all(

       execution::sender auto ...inputs  (since C++26)

   );

.SH Parameters

   inputs - senders upon which the completion of when_all is blocked. Can only include
            senders that can complete with a single set of values.

.SH Return value

   Returns a sender that completes once all of the input senders have completed. The
   values sent by this sender are the values sent by each of the input senders, in
   order of the arguments passed to when_all.

.SH Notes

     * The sender returned by when_all completes inline on the execution resource on
       which the last input sender completes, unless stop is requested before when_all
       is started, in which case it completes inline within the call to start.
