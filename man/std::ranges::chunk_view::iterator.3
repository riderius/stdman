.SH NAME
std::ranges::chunk_view::iterator \- std::ranges::chunk_view::iterator

.SH Synopsis
   template< bool Const >  (since C++23)
   class /*iterator*/      (exposition only*)

   The return type of chunk_view::begin, and of chunk_view::end when the underlying
   view V is a common_range.

   Present only if V models forward_range.

   The type /*iterator*/<true> is returned by the const-qualified overloads. The type
   /*iterator*/<false> is returned by the non-const-qualified overloads.

   Data members

   Member object      Definition
                      ranges::iterator_t<Base>, holds an iterator to the first element
   current_ (private) of current chunk in the underlying sequence (i.e. the begin of a
                      chunk).
                      (exposition-only member object*)
                      ranges::sentinel_t<Base>, holds a sentinel to the end of the
   end_ (private)     underlying sequence.
                      (exposition-only member object*)
                      ranges::range_difference_t<Base>, holds initial number of
   n_ (private)       elements in the chunk (the last chunk can be smaller).
                      (exposition-only member object*)
                      ranges::range_difference_t<Base>, usually equals to
   missing_ (private) ranges::advance(current_, n_, end_);.
