.SH NAME
std::basic_ospanstream::operator= \- std::basic_ospanstream::operator=

.SH Synopsis
   basic_ospanstream& operator=( basic_ospanstream&& other );         \fB(1)\fP (since C++23)
   basic_ospanstream& operator=( const basic_ospanstream& ) = delete; \fB(2)\fP (since C++23)

   1) Move assigns the other to *this, effectively move-assigning both the
   std::basic_ostream base class subobject and the wrapped std::basic_spanbuf.
   2) Copy assignment operator is deleted. basic_ospanstream is not copy assignable.

   Note that move assignment operator of the base class swaps all stream state
   variables (except for rdbuf()) between *this and other.

   It is implementation-defined whether the std::basic_spanbuf wrapped in other still
   holds an underlying buffer after the move assignment.

.SH Parameters

   other - another stream to move from

.SH Return value

   *this

.SH Exceptions

   May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
