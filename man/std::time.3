.TH std::time 3 "2024.06.10" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::time \- std::time

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <ctime>
   std::time_t time( std::time_t* arg );

   Returns the current calendar time encoded as a std::time_t object, and also stores
   it in the object pointed to by arg, unless arg is a null pointer.

.SH Parameters

   arg - pointer to a std::time_t object to store the time, or a null pointer

.SH Return value

   Current calendar time encoded as std::time_t object on success, (std::time_t)(-1) on
   error. If arg is not null, the return value is also stored in the object pointed to
   by arg.

.SH Notes

   The encoding of calendar time in std::time_t is unspecified, but most systems
   conform to the POSIX specification and return a value of integral type holding 86400
   times the number of calendar days since the Epoch plus the number of seconds that
   have passed since the last midnight UTC. Most notably, POSIX time does not (and can
   not) take leap seconds into account, so that this integral value is not equal to the
   number of S.I. seconds that have passed since the epoch, but rather is reduced with
   the number of leap seconds that have occurred since the epoch. Implementations in
   which std::time_t is a 32-bit signed integer (many historical implementations) fail
   in the year 2038.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <ctime>
 #include <iostream>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::time_t result = std::time(nullptr);
     std::cout << std::asctime(std::localtime(&result))
               << result << " seconds since the Epoch\\n";
 }

.SH Possible output:

 1316615272 seconds since the Epoch
