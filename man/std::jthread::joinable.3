.SH NAME
std::jthread::joinable \- std::jthread::joinable

.SH Synopsis
   [[nodiscard]] bool joinable() const noexcept;  \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Checks if the std::jthread object identifies an active thread of execution.
   Specifically, returns true if get_id() != std::jthread::id(). So a default
   constructed jthread is not joinable.

   A thread that has finished executing code, but has not yet been joined is still
   considered an active thread of execution and is therefore joinable.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   true if the jthread object identifies an active thread of execution, false
   otherwise.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <chrono>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <thread>
 using namespace std::chrono_literals;
  
 void foo()
 {
     std::this_thread::sleep_for(500ms);
 }
  
 int main()
 {
     std::cout << std::boolalpha;
  
     std::jthread t;
     std::cout << "before starting, joinable: " << t.joinable() << '\\n';
  
     t = std::jthread{foo};
     std::cout << "after starting, joinable: " << t.joinable() << '\\n';
  
     t.join();
     std::cout << "after joining, joinable: " << t.joinable() << '\\n';
  
     t = std::jthread{foo};
     t.detach();
     std::cout << "after detaching, joinable: " << t.joinable() << '\\n';
  
 }

.SH Output:

 before starting, joinable: false
 after starting, joinable: true
 after joining, joinable: false
 after detaching, joinable: false
