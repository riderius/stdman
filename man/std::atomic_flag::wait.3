.SH Synopsis
   void wait( bool old, std::memory_order order =
                            std::memory_order::seq_cst ) const        \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP
   noexcept;
   void wait( bool old, std::memory_order order =
                            std::memory_order::seq_cst ) const        \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP
   volatile noexcept;

   Performs atomic waiting operations. Behaves as if it repeatedly performs the
   following steps:

     * Compare this->test(order) with that of old.
          * If those are equal, then blocks until *this is notified by notify_one() or
            notify_all(), or the thread is unblocked spuriously.
          * Otherwise, returns.

   These functions are guaranteed to return only if value has changed, even if
   underlying implementation unblocks spuriously.

   If order is one of std::memory_order::release and std::memory_order::acq_rel, the
   behavior is undefined.

.SH Parameters

   old   - the value to check the atomic_flag's object no longer contains
   order - memory order constraints to enforce

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Notes

   This form of change-detection is often more efficient than simple polling or pure
   spinlocks.

   Due to the ABA problem, transient changes from old to another value and back to old
   might be missed, and not unblock.
