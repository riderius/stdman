.SH NAME
std::barrier::arrive_and_drop \- std::barrier::arrive_and_drop

.SH Synopsis
   void arrive_and_drop();  \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Decrements the initial expected count for all subsequent phases by one, and then
   decrements the expected count for the current phase by one.

   This function is executed atomically. The call to this function strongly
   happens-before the start of the phase completion step for the current phase.

   The behavior is undefined if the expected count for the current phase is zero.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

   Throws std::system_error with an error code allowed for mutex types on error.

.SH Notes

   This function can cause the completion step for the current phase to start.

   If the current expected count is zero before calling this function, the initial
   expected count for all subsequent phases is also zero, which means the barrier
   cannot be reused.
