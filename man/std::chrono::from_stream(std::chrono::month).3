   std::basic_istream<CharT, Traits>&
       from_stream( std::basic_istream<CharT, Traits>& is, const CharT*
   fmt,                                                                   \fI(since C++20)\fP
                    std::chrono::month& m,
                    std::basic_string<CharT, Traits, Alloc>* abbrev =
   nullptr,

                    std::chrono::minutes* offset = nullptr );

   Attempts to parse the input stream is into the std::chrono::month m according to the
   format string fmt.

   Behaves as an UnformattedInputFunction, except that it has an unspecified effect on
   is.gcount(). After constructing and checking the sentry object, attempts to parse
   the input stream is into m according to the format string fmt. If the parse fails to
   decode a valid month, is.setstate(std::ios_base::failbit) is called and m is not
   modified.

   If the format specifier %Z is used and successfully parsed, the parsed value is
   assigned to *abbrev if abbrev is not null. If the format specifier %z or a modified
   variant is used and successfully parsed, the parsed value is assigned to *offset if
   offset is not null.

.SH Parameters

   is     - an input stream
   fmt    - a format string (see below)
   m      - object to hold the parse result
   abbrev - if not null, pointer to an object that will hold the time zone abbreviation
            or name corresponding to the %Z specifier
   offset - if not null, pointer to an object that will hold the offset from UTC
            corresponding to the %z specifier

   Format string

   The format string consists of zero or more conversion specifiers and ordinary
   characters. Each ordinary character, excluding whitespace characters and the
   terminating null character, matches one identical character from the input stream,
   or causes the function to fail if the next character on the stream does not compare
   equal.

   Each whitespace character matches zero or more whitespace characters in the input
   stream.

   Each unmodified conversion specifier begins with a % character followed by a
   character that determines the behavior of the specifier. Some conversion specifiers
   have a modified form in which an E or O modifier character is inserted after the %
   character. Some conversion specifiers have a modified form in which a width
   parameter given as a positive decimal integer (shown as N below) is inserted after
   the % character. Each conversion specifier causes the matched characters to be
   interpreted as parts of date and time types according to the table below.

   A character sequence in the format string that begins with a % but does not match
   one of the conversion specifiers below is interpreted as ordinary characters.

   If from_stream fails to parse everything specified by the format string, or if
   insufficient information is parsed to specify a complete result, or if parsing
   discloses contradictory information, is.setstate(std::ios_base::failbit) is called.

   The following conversion specifiers are available:

   Conversion                               Explanation
   specifier
       %%     Matches a literal % character.
       %n     Matches one whitespace character.
       %t     Matches zero or one whitespace character.
