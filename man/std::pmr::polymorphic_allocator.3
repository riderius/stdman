.SH NAME
std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator \- std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <memory_resource>
   template< class T >                  \fI(since C++17)\fP
   class polymorphic_allocator;         \fI(until C++20)\fP
   template< class T = std::byte >      \fI(since C++20)\fP
   class polymorphic_allocator;

   The class template std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator is an Allocator which exhibits
   different allocation behavior depending upon the std::pmr::memory_resource from
   which it is constructed. Since memory_resource uses runtime polymorphism to manage
   allocations, different container instances with polymorphic_allocator as their
   static allocator type are interoperable, but can behave as if they had different
   allocator types.

   All specializations of polymorphic_allocator meet the allocator completeness
   requirements.

   The polymorphic_allocator::construct member function does uses-allocator
   construction, so that the elements of a container using a polymorphic_allocator will
   use that same allocator for their own allocations. For example, a
   std::pmr::vector<std::pmr::string> will use the same memory_resource for the
   vector's storage and each string's storage.

   For non-polymorphic allocators, similar propagation can be achieved with the help of
   std::scoped_allocator_adaptor.

.SH Notes

   polymorphic_allocator does not propagate on container copy assignment, move
   assignment, or swap. As a result, move assignment of a polymorphic_allocator-using
   container can throw, and swapping two polymorphic_allocator-using containers whose
   allocators do not compare equal results in undefined behavior.
