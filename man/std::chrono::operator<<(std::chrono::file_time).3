.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   template< class CharT, class Traits, class Duration >

   std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&                             \fI(since C++20)\fP
       operator<<( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os,

                   const std::chrono::file_time<Duration>& tp );

   Outputs tp into the stream os, as if by os << std::format(os.getloc(),
   STATICALLY-WIDEN("{:L%F %T}"), tp), where STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L%F %T}") is
   "{:L%F %T}" if CharT is char, and L"{:L%F %T}" if CharT is wchar_t.
