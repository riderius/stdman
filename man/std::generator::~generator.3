.SH NAME
std::generator::~generator \- std::generator::~generator

.SH Synopsis
   ~generator();  (since C++23)

   Destructs the generator object.

   Given coroutine_ as the underlying coroutine object, equivalent to:

 if (coroutine_)
     coroutine_.destroy();

   Note, that destroying the root generator effectively destroys the entire stack of
   yielded generators, because the ownership of recursively yielded generators is held
   in awaitable objects in the coroutine frame of the yielding generator.
