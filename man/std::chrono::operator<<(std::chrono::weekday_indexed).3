.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   template< class CharT, class Traits >

   std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&                          \fI(since C++20)\fP
       operator<<( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os,

                   const std::chrono::weekday_indexed& wdi );

   Outputs a textual representation of wdi into the stream os, as if by:

   if (wdi.index() >=1 && wdi.index() <= 5)
       os << std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L}[{}]"),
                         wdi.weekday(), wdi.index());
   else
       os << std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L}[{} is not a valid
   index]"),
                         wdi.weekday(), wdi.index());

   where STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("...") is "..." if CharT is char, and L"..." if CharT
   is wchar_t.
