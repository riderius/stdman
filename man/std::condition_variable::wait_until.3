.SH Synopsis
   template< class Clock, class Duration >

   std::cv_status
       wait_until( std::unique_lock<std::mutex>& lock,                \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

                   const std::chrono::time_point<Clock, Duration>&
   abs_time );
   template< class Clock, class Duration, class Predicate >

   bool wait_until( std::unique_lock<std::mutex>& lock,
                    const std::chrono::time_point<Clock, Duration>&   \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   abs_time,

                    Predicate pred );

   wait_until causes the current thread to block until the condition variable is
   notified, the given time point has been reached, or a spurious wakeup occurs. pred
   can be optionally provided to detect spurious wakeup.

   1) Atomically calls lock.unlock() and blocks on *this.
   The thread will be unblocked when notify_all() or notify_one() is executed, or
   abs_time is reached. It may also be unblocked spuriously.
   When unblocked, calls lock.lock() (possibly blocking on the lock), then returns.
   2) Equivalent to while (!pred())
       if (wait_until(lock, abs_time) == std::cv_status::timeout)
           return pred();
   return true;.
   This overload may be used to ignore spurious awakenings while waiting for a specific
   condition to become true.
   If pred() is ill-formed, or
   the return value of pred() is not convertible to bool
   \fI(until C++20)\fP
   decltype(pred()) does not model boolean-testable
   \fI(since C++20)\fP, the program is ill-formed.

   Right after wait_until returns, lock.owns_lock() is true, and lock.mutex() is locked
   by the calling thread. If these postconditions cannot be satisfied^[1], calls
   std::terminate.

   If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is undefined:

     * lock.owns_lock() is false.
     * lock.mutex() is not locked by the calling thread.
     * If some other threads are also waiting on *this, lock.mutex() is different from
       the mutex unlocked by the waiting functions (wait, wait_for and wait_until)
       called on *this by those threads.
    1. â†‘ This can happen if the re-locking of the mutex throws an exception.

.SH Parameters

   lock     - an lock which must be locked by the calling thread
   abs_time - the time point where waiting expires
   pred     - the predicate to check whether the waiting can be completed
.SH Type requirements
   -
   Predicate must meet the requirements of FunctionObject.

.SH Return value

   1) std::cv_status::timeout if abs_time has been reached, otherwise
   std::cv_status::no_timeout.
   2) The latest result of pred() before returning to the caller.

.SH Exceptions

   1) Timeout-related exceptions.
   2) Timeout-related exceptions, and any exception thrown by pred.

.SH Notes

   The standard recommends that the clock tied to abs_time be used to measure time;
   that clock is not required to be a monotonic clock. There are no guarantees
   regarding the behavior of this function if the clock is adjusted discontinuously,
   but the existing implementations convert abs_time from Clock to
   std::chrono::system_clock and delegate to POSIX pthread_cond_timedwait so that the
   wait honors adjustments to the system clock, but not to the user-provided Clock. In
   any case, the function also may wait for longer than until after abs_time has been
   reached due to scheduling or resource contention delays.

   Even if the clock in use is std::chrono::steady_clock or another monotonic clock, a
   system clock adjustment may induce a spurious wakeup.

   The effects of notify_one()/notify_all() and each of the three atomic parts of
   wait()/wait_for()/wait_until() (unlock+wait, wakeup, and lock) take place in a
   single total order that can be viewed as modification order of an atomic variable:
   the order is specific to this individual condition variable. This makes it
   impossible for notify_one() to, for example, be delayed and unblock a thread that
   started waiting just after the call to notify_one() was made.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <chrono>
 #include <condition_variable>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <thread>
  
 std::condition_variable cv;
 std::mutex cv_m; // This mutex is used for three purposes:
                  // 1) to synchronize accesses to i
                  // 2) to synchronize accesses to std::cerr
                  // 3) for the condition variable cv
 int i = 0;
  
 void waits()
 {
     std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk(cv_m);
     std::cerr << "Waiting... \\n";
     cv.wait(lk, []{ return i == 1; });
     std::cerr << "...finished waiting. i == 1\\n";
 }
  
 void signals()
 {
     std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
     {
         std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk(cv_m);
         std::cerr << "Notifying...\\n";
     }
     cv.notify_all();
  
     std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));
  
     {
         std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lk(cv_m);
         i = 1;
         std::cerr << "Notifying again...\\n";
     }
     cv.notify_all();
 }
  
 int main()
 {
     std::thread t1(waits), t2(waits), t3(waits), t4(signals);
     t1.join();
     t2.join();
     t3.join();
     t4.join();
 }

.SH Possible output:

 Waiting...

 Notifying again...
 ...finished waiting. i == 1
 ...finished waiting. i == 1
 ...finished waiting. i == 1
