   [[nodiscard]] void* allocate( std::size_t bytes,
                                 std::size_t alignment =                  \fI(since C++20)\fP
   alignof(std::max_align_t) );

   Allocates storage with a size of at least bytes bytes, aligned to the specified
   alignment.

   Equivalent to return do_allocate(bytes, alignment);.

   obtained.
