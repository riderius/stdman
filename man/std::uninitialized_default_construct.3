.SH NAME
std::uninitialized_default_construct \- std::uninitialized_default_construct

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <memory>
   template< class ForwardIt >
   void uninitialized_default_construct( ForwardIt first, ForwardIt   \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   last );
   template< class ExecutionPolicy, class ForwardIt >

   void uninitialized_default_construct( ExecutionPolicy&& policy,    \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP

                                         ForwardIt first, ForwardIt
   last );

   1) Constructs objects of type typename std::iterator_traits<ForwardIt>::value_type
   in the uninitialized storage designated by the range [first, last) by
   default-initialization, as if by for (; first != last; ++first)
       ::new (static_cast<void*>(std::addressof(*first)))
           typename std::iterator_traits<ForwardIt>::value_type;
   If an exception is thrown during the initialization, the objects already constructed
   are destroyed in an unspecified order.
   2) Same as \fB(1)\fP, but executed according to policy. This overload participates in
   overload resolution only if

   std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.        (until
                                                                             C++20)
   std::is_execution_policy_v<std::remove_cvref_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true. (since
                                                                             C++20)

.SH Parameters

   first, last          -         the range of the elements to initialize
   policy               -         the execution policy to use. See execution policy for
                                  details.
.SH Type requirements
   -
   ForwardIt must meet the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator.
   -
   No increment, assignment, comparison, or indirection through valid instances of
   ForwardIt may throw exceptions.

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Complexity

   Linear in the distance between first and last.

.SH Exceptions

   The overload with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy reports errors as
   follows:

     * If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws an exception
       and ExecutionPolicy is one of the standard policies, std::terminate is called.
       For any other ExecutionPolicy, the behavior is implementation-defined.
     * If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is thrown.

.SH Possible implementation

   template<class ForwardIt>
   void uninitialized_default_construct(ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last)
   {
       using Value = typename std::iterator_traits<ForwardIt>::value_type;
       ForwardIt current = first;
       try
       {
           for (; current != last; ++current)
           {
               ::new (const_cast<void*>(static_cast<const volatile void*>(
                   std::addressof(*current)))) Value;
           }
       }
       catch (...)
       {
           std::destroy(first, current);
           throw;
       }
   }

         for (auto it{first}; it != last; ++it)
             std::cout << it->m << '\\n';
  
         std::destroy(first, last);
     }
     catch (...)
     {
         std::cout << "Exception!\\n";
     }
  
     // Notice that for "trivial types" the uninitialized_default_construct
     // generally does not zero-fill the given uninitialized memory area.
     int v[]{1, 2, 3, 4};
     const int original[]{1, 2, 3, 4};
     std::uninitialized_default_construct(std::begin(v), std::end(v));
  
     // Maybe undefined behavior, pending CWG 1997.
     // for (const int i : v)
     //     std::cout << i << ' ';
  
     // The result is unspecified.
     std::cout <<
         (std::memcmp(v, original, sizeof(v)) == 0 ? "Unmodified\\n" : "Modified\\n");
 }
