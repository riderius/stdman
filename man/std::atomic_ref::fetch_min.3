.SH NAME
std::atomic_ref::fetch_min \- std::atomic_ref::fetch_min

.SH Synopsis
   member only of atomic_ref<Integralâ€Š> specializations
   T fetch_min( T arg, std::memory_order order =
                           std::memory_order_seq_cst ) const          \fB(1)\fP (since C++26)
   noexcept;
   member only of atomic_ref<T*> partial specialization
   T* fetch_min( T* arg, std::memory_order order =
                             std::memory_order_seq_cst ) const        \fB(2)\fP (since C++26)
   noexcept;

   Atomically replaces the current value of the referenced object with the result of
   std::min of the value and arg. That is, it performs atomic minimum operation. The
   operation is a read-modify-write operation. Memory is affected according to the
   value of order.

   2) If the pointers point to different complete objects (or subobjects thereof),
   pointer comparison does not establish a strict weak ordering.

.SH Parameters

   arg   - the other argument of std::min
   order - memory order constraints to enforce

.SH Return value

   The value immediately preceding the effects of this function in the modification
   order of *this.
