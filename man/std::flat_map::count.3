.SH NAME
std::flat_map::count \- std::flat_map::count

.SH Synopsis
   size_type count( const Key& key ) const; \fB(1)\fP (since C++23)
   template< class K >                      \fB(2)\fP (since C++23)
   size_type count( const K& x ) const;

   Returns the number of elements with key that compares equivalent to the specified
   argument.

   1) Returns the number of elements with key key. This is either 1 or 0 since this
   container does not allow duplicates.
   2) Returns the number of elements with key that compares equivalent to the value x.
   This overload participates in overload resolution only if the qualified-id
   Compare::is_transparent is valid and denotes a type. It allows calling this function
   without constructing an instance of Key.

.SH Parameters

   key - key value of the elements to count
   x   - alternative value to compare to the keys

.SH Return value

   Number of elements with key that compares equivalent to key or x, which, for
   overload \fB(1)\fP, is either 1 or 0.

.SH Complexity

   Logarithmic in the size of the container plus linear in the number of elements
   found.
