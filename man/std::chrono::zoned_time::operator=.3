.SH Synopsis
   zoned_time& operator=( const zoned_time& other ) = default;        \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP
   zoned_time& operator=( const std::chrono::sys_time<Duration>&      \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP
   other );
   zoned_time& operator=( const std::chrono::local_time<Duration>&    \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP
   other );

   Assign the value of other to *this.

   1) Defaulted copy assignment operator. Copy-assigns both the stored time point and
   the stored time zone pointer. zoned_time has no move assignment operator; a move is
   a copy.
   2) Assigns other to the stored time point. The time zone pointer is unchanged. After
   this call, get_sys_time() == other.
   3) Converts other to a std::chrono::sys_time as if by zone->to_sys(other) (where
   zone is the non-static data member holding the stored time zone pointer) and assigns
   the result to the stored time point. The time zone pointer is unchanged. After this
   call, get_local_time() == other.

.SH Return value

   *this
