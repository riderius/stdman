.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <ios>
   typedef /*implementation-defined*/ streamoff;

   The type std::streamoff is an implementation-defined
   signed integral
   \fI(since C++11)\fP type of sufficient size to represent the maximum possible file size
   supported by the operating system.
   Typically, this is an alias for long long.
   \fI(since C++11)\fP

   It is used to represent offsets from stream positions (values of type std::fpos). A
   std::streamoff value constructed from -1 is also used to represent error conditions
   by some of the I/O library functions.

   Relationship with std::fpos

     * the difference between two std::fpos objects is a value of type std::streamoff
     * a value of type std::streamoff may be added or subtracted from std::fpos
       yielding a different std::fpos.
     * a value of type std::fpos is implicitly convertible to std::streamoff (the
       conversion result is the offset from the beginning of the file).
     * a value of type std::fpos is constructible from a value of type std::streamoff
