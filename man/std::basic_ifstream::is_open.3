.SH NAME
std::basic_ifstream::is_open \- std::basic_ifstream::is_open

.SH Synopsis

 #include <string>
  
 // this file is called main.cpp
  
 bool file_exists(const std::string& str)
 {
     std::ifstream fs(str);
     return fs.is_open();
 }
  
 int main()
 {
     std::boolalpha(std::cout);
     std::cout << file_exists("main.cpp")  << '\\n'
               << file_exists("strange_file") << '\\n';
