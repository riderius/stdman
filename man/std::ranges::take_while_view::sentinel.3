std::ranges::take_while_view::sentinel \- std::ranges::take_while_view::sentinel

.SH Synopsis
   template< bool Const >  \fI(since C++20)\fP
   class /*sentinel*/;     (exposition only*)

   The return type of take_while_view::end.

   The type /*sentinel*/<true> is returned by the const-qualified overload. The type
   /*sentinel*/<false> is returned by the non-const-qualified overload.

.SH Member types

   Member type    Definition
   Base (private) const V if Const is true, otherwise V.
                  (exposition-only member type*)

   Data members

   Member object     Definition
                     A sentinel of type std::sentinel_t<Base> that represents the end
   end_ (private)    of the underlying view.
                     (exposition-only member object*)
   parent_ (private) A pointer Pred* to the predicate.
                     (exposition-only member object*)
