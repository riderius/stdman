   [[nodiscard]] static constexpr pointer allocate(     \fB(2)\fP
   Alloc& a, size_type n,                                                 \fI(since C++20)\fP
                                                  
    const_void_pointer hint );

   Uses the allocator a to allocate n * sizeof(Alloc::value_type) bytes of
   uninitialized storage. An array of type Alloc::value_type[n] is created in the
   storage, but none of its elements are constructed.

   1) Calls a.allocate(n).
   2) Additionally passes memory locality hint hint. Calls a.allocate(n, hint) if
   possible. If not possible (e.g. a has no two-argument member function allocate),
   calls a.allocate(n).

.SH Parameters

   a    - allocator to use
   n    - the number of objects to allocate storage for
   hint - pointer to a nearby memory location

.SH Return value

   The pointer returned by the call to a.allocate(n).

.SH Notes

   Alloc::allocate was not required to create array object until P0593R6, which made
   using non-default allocator for std::vector and some other containers not
   well-defined according to a strict reading of the core language specification.

   After calling allocate and before construction of elements, pointer arithmetic of
   Alloc::value_type* is well-defined within the allocated array, but the behavior is
   undefined if elements are accessed.
