.SH NAME
std::map::extract \- std::map::extract

.SH Synopsis
   node_type extract( const_iterator position ); \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   node_type extract( const Key& k );            \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
   template< class K >                           \fB(3)\fP (since C++23)
   node_type extract( K&& x );

   1) Unlinks the node that contains the element pointed to by position and returns a
   node handle that owns it.
   2) If the container has an element with key equivalent to k, unlinks the node that
   contains that element from the container and returns a node handle that owns it.
   Otherwise, returns an empty node handle.
   3) Same as \fB(2)\fP. This overload participates in overload resolution only if the
   qualified-id Compare::is_transparent is valid and denotes a type, and neither
   iterator nor const_iterator is implicitly convertible from K. It allows calling this
   function without constructing an instance of Key.

   In either case, no elements are copied or moved, only the internal pointers of the
   container nodes are repointed (rebalancing may occur, as with erase()).

   Extracting a node invalidates only the iterators to the extracted element. Pointers
   and references to the extracted element remain valid, but cannot be used while
   element is owned by a node handle: they become usable if the element is inserted
   into a container.

.SH Parameters

   position - a valid iterator into this container
   k        - a key to identify the node to be extracted
   x        - a value of any type that can be transparently compared with a key
              identifying the node to be extracted

.SH Return value

   A node handle that owns the extracted element, or empty node handle in case the
   element is not found in (2,3).

.SH Exceptions

   1) Throws nothing.
   2,3) Any exceptions thrown by the Compare object.

.SH Complexity

   1) Amortized constant.
   2,3) log(size())

.SH Notes

   extract is the only way to change a key of a map element without reallocation:

 std::map<int, std::string> m{{1, "mango"}, {2, "papaya"}, {3, "guava"}};
 auto nh = m.extract\fB(2)\fP;
 nh.key() = 4;
 m.insert(std::move(nh));
 // m == {{1, "mango"}, {3, "guava"}, {4, "papaya"}}

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <algorithm>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <string_view>
 #include <map>
  
 void print(std::string_view comment, const auto& data)
 {
     std::cout << comment;
     for (auto [k, v] : data)
         std::cout << ' ' << k << '(' << v << ')';
  
     std::cout << '\\n';
 }
  
 int main()
 {
     std::map<int, char> cont{{1, 'a'}, {2, 'b'}, {3, 'c'}};
  
     print("Start:", cont);
  
     // Extract node handle and change key
     auto nh = cont.extract(1);
     nh.key() = 4;
  
     print("After extract and before insert:", cont);
  
     // Insert node handle back
     cont.insert(std::move(nh));
  
     print("End:", cont);
 }

.SH Output:

 Start: 1(a) 2(b) 3(c)
 After extract and before insert: 2(b) 3(c)
 End: 2(b) 3(c) 4(a)
