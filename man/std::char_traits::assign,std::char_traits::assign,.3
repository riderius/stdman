.SH Synopsis
                            std::char_traits<char32_t>::assign

   static void assign( char_type& c1, const char_type& c2   \fB(1)\fP (noexcept since C++11)
   );                                                           (constexpr since C++17)
   static char_type* assign( char_type* ptr, std::size_t    \fB(2)\fP (constexpr since C++20)
   count, char_type c2 );

   1) Assigns c2 to c1, behaves identically to c1 = c2.
   2) Assigns c2 to each character in count characters in the character sequence
   pointed to by ptr.

   See CharTraits for the general requirements on character traits for X::assign.

.SH Parameters

   c1    - character to assign to
   c2    - character value to assign
   ptr   - pointer to a character sequence to assign to
   count - the length of the character sequence

.SH Return value

   1) \fI(none)\fP
   2) ptr

.SH Complexity

   1) Constant.
   2) Linear in count.
