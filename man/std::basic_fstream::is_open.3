.SH NAME
std::basic_fstream::is_open \- std::basic_fstream::is_open

.SH Synopsis
   bool is_open() const;

   Checks if the file stream has an associated file.

   Effectively calls rdbuf()->is_open().

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   true if the file stream has an associated file, false otherwise.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <fstream>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <string>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::string filename = "some_file";
  
     std::fstream fs(filename, std::ios::in);
  
     std::cout << std::boolalpha;
     std::cout << "fs.is_open() = " << fs.is_open() << '\\n';
  
     if (!fs.is_open())
     {
         fs.clear();
         fs.open(filename, std::ios::out);
         std::cout << "fs.is_open() = " << fs.is_open() << '\\n';
     }
 }

.SH Possible output:

 fs.is_open() = false
 fs.is_open() = true
