.SH Synopsis
   lognormal_distribution() : lognormal_distribution(0.0) {}        \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   explicit lognormal_distribution( RealType m, RealType s = 1.0 ); \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   explicit lognormal_distribution( const param_type& params );     \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Constructs a new distribution object.

   2) Uses m and s as the distribution parameters.
   3) Uses params as the distribution parameters.

.SH Parameters

   m      - the m distribution parameter (log-scale)
   s      - the s distribution parameter (shape)
   params - the distribution parameter set
