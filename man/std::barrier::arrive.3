.SH NAME
std::barrier::arrive \- std::barrier::arrive

.SH Synopsis
   [[nodiscard]] arrival_token arrive( std::ptrdiff_t n = 1 );  \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Constructs an arrival_token object associated with the phase synchronization point
   for the current phase. Then, decrements the expected count by n.

   This function executes atomically. The call to this function strongly happens-before
   the start of the phase completion step for the current phase.

   The behavior is undefined if n is less than or equal to 0 or greater than the
   expected count for the current barrier phase.

.SH Parameters

   n - the value by which the expected count is decreased

.SH Return value

   The constructed arrival_token object.

.SH Exceptions

   Throws std::system_error with an error code allowed for mutex types on error.

.SH Notes

   This function can cause the completion step for the current phase to start.
