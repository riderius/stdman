.SH NAME
std::experimental::reflect::ScopeMember \- std::experimental::reflect::ScopeMember

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/reflect>
   template< class T >                                 (reflection TS)
   concept ScopeMember = Named<T> && /* see below */;

   The ScopeMember concept is satisfied if and only if T satisfies RecordMember,
   Enumerator, or Variable, or if T reflects a namespace that is not the global
   namespace (Note: The scope of members of an unnamed union is the unnamed union; the
   scope of enumerators is their type).
