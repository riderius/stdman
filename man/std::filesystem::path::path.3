   Constructs a new path object.

   1) Constructs an empty path.
   2) Copy constructor. Constructs a path whose pathname, in both native and generic
   formats, is the same as that of p.
   3) Move constructor. Constructs a path whose pathname, in both native and generic
   formats, is the same as that of p, p is left in valid but unspecified state.
   4-6) Constructs the path from a character sequence (format interpreted as specified
   by fmt) provided by source (4,5), which is a pointer or an input iterator to a
   null-terminated character/wide character sequence, an std::basic_string or an
   std::basic_string_view, or represented as a pair of input iterators [first, last)
   \fB(6)\fP. Any of the character types char,
   char8_t,
   \fI(since C++20)\fPchar16_t, char32_t, wchar_t is allowed, and the method of conversion to
   the native character set depends on the character type used by source.

     * If the source character type is char, the encoding of the source is assumed to
       be the native narrow encoding (so no conversion takes place on POSIX systems).

     * If the source character type is char8_t, conversion from UTF-8 to  \fI(since C++20)\fP
       native filesystem encoding is used.

     * If the source character type is char16_t, conversion from UTF-16 to native
       filesystem encoding is used.
     * If the source character type is char32_t, conversion from UTF-32 to native
       filesystem encoding is used.
     * If the source character type is wchar_t, the input is assumed to be the native
       wide encoding (so no conversion takes places on Windows).
   7,8) Constructs the path from a character sequence (format interpreted as specified
   by fmt) provided by source \fB(7)\fP, which is a pointer or an input iterator to a
   null-terminated character sequence, an std::string, an std::string_view, or
   represented as a pair of input iterators [first, last) \fB(8)\fP. The only character type
   allowed is char. Uses loc to perform the character encoding conversion. If
   value_type is wchar_t, converts from to wide using the std::codecvt<wchar_t, char,
   std::mbstate_t> facet of loc. Otherwise, first converts to wide using the
   std::codecvt<wchar_t, char, std::mbstate_t> facet and then converts to filesystem
   native character type using std::codecvt<wchar_t,value_type> facet of loc.

   \fB(5)\fP and \fB(7)\fP participate in overload resolution only if Source and path are not the
   same type, and either:

     * Source is a specialization of std::basic_string or std::basic_string_view, or
     * std::iterator_traits<std::decay_t<Source>>::value_type is valid and denotes a
       possibly const-qualified encoding character type (char,
       char8_t,
       \fI(since C++20)\fPchar16_t, char32_t, or wchar_t).

.SH Parameters

   p           - a path to copy
                 std::basic_string, std::basic_string_view, pointer to a
   source      - null-terminated character string, or input iterator with a character
                 value type that points to a null-terminated character sequence (the
                 character type must be char for overload \fB(7)\fP)
   first, last - pair of LegacyInputIterators that specify a character sequence
   fmt         - enumerator of type path::format which specifies how pathname format is
                 to be interpreted
   loc         - locale that defines encoding conversion to use
.SH Type requirements
   -
   InputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator.
   -
   The value type of InputIt must be one of the character types char, wchar_t,
   char8_t,
   \fI(since C++20)\fPchar16_t and char32_t to use the overload \fB(6)\fP.
   -
   The value type of InputIt must be char to use the overload \fB(8)\fP.

.SH Exceptions

   2,4-8) May throw implementation-defined exceptions.

.SH Notes

   For portable pathname generation from Unicode strings, see u8path.     \fI(until C++20)\fP
   path constructor supports creation from UTF-8 string when the source   \fI(since C++20)\fP
   is a sequence of char8_t.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <filesystem>
 #include <iostream>
 namespace fs = std::filesystem;
  
 int main()
 {
     fs::path p1 = "/usr/lib/sendmail.cf"; // portable format
     fs::path p2 = "C:\\\\users\\\\abcdef\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\"; // native format
     fs::path p3 = U"D:/猫.txt"; // UTF-32 string
     fs::path p4 = u8"~/狗.txt"; // UTF-8 string
  
     std::cout << "p1 = " << p1 << '\\n'
               << "p2 = " << p2 << '\\n'
               << "p3 = " << p3 << '\\n'
               << "p4 = " << p4 << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 p1 = "/usr/lib/sendmail.cf"
 p2 = "C:\\\\users\\\\abcdef\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\"
 p3 = "D:/猫.txt"
 p4 = "~/狗.txt"
