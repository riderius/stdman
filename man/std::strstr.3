.SH NAME
std::strstr \- std::strstr

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstring>
   const char* strstr( const char* haystack, const char* needle );
       char* strstr(       char* haystack, const char* needle );

   Finds the first occurrence of the byte string needle in the byte string pointed to
   by haystack. The terminating null characters are not compared.

.SH Parameters

   haystack - pointer to the null-terminated byte string to examine
   needle   - pointer to the null-terminated byte string to search for

.SH Return value

   Pointer to the first character of the found substring in haystack, or a null pointer
   if no such character is found. If needle points to an empty string, haystack is
   returned.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <cstring>
 #include <iostream>
  
 int main()
 {
     const char* str = "Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try.";
     const char* target = "not";
     const char* result = str;
  
     while ((result = std::strstr(result, target)))
     {
         std::cout << "Found '" << target
                   << "' starting at '" << result << "'\\n";
  
         // Increment result, otherwise we'll find target at the same location
         ++result;
     }
 }

.SH Output:

 Found 'not' starting at 'not. Do, or do not. There is no try.'
 Found 'not' starting at 'not. There is no try.'
