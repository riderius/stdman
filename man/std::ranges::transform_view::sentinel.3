std::ranges::transform_view::sentinel \- std::ranges::transform_view::sentinel

.SH Synopsis
   template< bool Const >  \fI(since C++20)\fP
   class /*sentinel*/      (exposition only*)

   The return type of transform_view::end when the underlying view is not a
   common_range.

   The type /*sentinel*/<true> is returned by the const-qualified overload. The type
   /*sentinel*/<false> is returned by the non-const-qualified overload.

.SH Member types

   Member type      Definition
                    const transform_view<V, F> if Const is true, otherwise
   Parent (private) transform_view<V, F>.
                    (exposition-only member type*)
   Base (private)   const V if Const is true, otherwise V.
                    (exposition-only member type*)

   Data members

   Member object  Definition
                  A sentinel of type std::sentinel_t<Base> obtained from (possibly
   end_ (private) const-qualified) V.
                  (exposition-only member object*)
