   packaged_task& operator=( packaged_task&& rhs ) noexcept;  \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   1) Copy assignment operator is deleted, std::packaged_task is move-only.
   2) Releases the shared state, if any, destroys the previously-held task, and moves
   the shared state and the task owned by rhs into *this. rhs is left without a shared
   state and with a moved-from task.
