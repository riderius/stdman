.SH NAME
std::owner_hash \- std::owner_hash

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <memory>
   struct owner_hash;          (since C++26)

   This function object provides owner-based (as opposed to value-based) hashing of
   both std::weak_ptr and std::shared_ptr.

.SH Member functions

   operator() calculates the hash of the shared-ownership pointer
              \fI(function)\fP

std::owner_hash::operator()

   template< class T >
   std::size_t operator()( const std::shared_ptr<T>& key ) const      \fB(1)\fP (since C++26)
   noexcept;
   template< class T >
   std::size_t operator()( const std::weak_ptr<T>& key ) const        \fB(2)\fP (since C++26)
   noexcept;

   Equivalent to return key.owner_hash();.

.SH Parameters

   key - shared-ownership pointer to be hashed

.SH Return value

   A hash value that is identical for any std::shared_ptr or std::weak_ptr object
   sharing the same ownership.
