.SH NAME
std::basic_streambuf::showmanyc \- std::basic_streambuf::showmanyc

.SH Synopsis
   protected:
   virtual std::streamsize showmanyc();

   Estimates the number of characters available for input in the associated character
   sequence. underflow() is guaranteed not to return Traits::eof() or throw an
   exception until at least that many characters are extracted.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   The number of characters that are certainly available in the associated character
   sequence, or -1 if showmanyc can determine, without blocking, that no characters are
   available. If showmanyc returns -1, underflow() and uflow() will definitely return
   Traits::eof or throw.

   The base class version returns 0, which has the meaning of "unsure if there are
   characters available in the associated sequence".

.SH Notes

   The name of this function stands for "stream: how many characters?", so it is
   pronounced "S how many C", rather than "show many C".
