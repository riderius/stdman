.SH NAME
std::chrono::operator<<(std::chrono::weekday) \- std::chrono::operator<<(std::chrono::weekday)

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   template< class CharT, class Traits >

   std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&                                     \fI(since C++20)\fP

       operator<<( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os, const
   std::chrono::weekday& wd );

   If !wd.ok(), inserts wd.c_encoding() followed by " is not a valid weekday" into os.
   Otherwise, forms a std::basic_string<CharT> s consisting of the abbreviated weekday
   name for the weekday represented by wd, determined using the locale associated with
   os, and inserts s into os.

   Equivalent to

   return os << (wd.ok() ?
       std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{:L%a}"), wd) :
       std::format(os.getloc(), STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("{} is not a valid weekday"),
                   wd.c_encoding()));

   where STATICALLY_WIDEN<CharT>("...") is "..." if CharT is char, and L"..." if CharT
   is wchar_t.
