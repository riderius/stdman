std::ctype \- std::ctype

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   template< class CharT >
   class ctype;

   Class ctype encapsulates character classification features. All stream input
   operations performed through std::basic_istream<CharT> use the std::ctype<CharT> of
   the locale imbued in the stream to identify whitespace characters for input
   tokenization. Stream output operations apply std::ctype<CharT>::widen() to
   narrow-character arguments prior to output.

.SH Specializations

   The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following specializations (they
   are required to be implemented by any locale object):

   Defined in header <locale>
                       provides narrow character equivalents of the minimal "C" locale
   std::ctype<char>    classification. This specialization uses table lookup for
                       character classification
   std::ctype<wchar_t> provides wide character classification appropriate to the native
                       character set

.SH Example

   The following example demonstrates modification of a ctype other than ctype<char> to
   tokenize a CSV file:

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <locale>
 #include <sstream>
  
 struct csv_whitespace : std::ctype<wchar_t>
 {
     bool do_is(mask m, char_type c) const
     {
         if ((m & space) && c == L' ')
             return false; // space will NOT be classified as whitespace
  
         if ((m & space) && c == L',')
             return true; // comma will be classified as whitespace
  
         return ctype::do_is(m, c); // leave the rest to the base class
     }
 };
  
 int main()
 {
     std::wstring in = L"Column 1,Column 2,Column 3\\n123,456,789";
     std::wstring token;
  
     std::wcout << "default locale:\\n";
     std::wistringstream s1(in);
     while (s1 >> token)
         std::wcout << "  " << token << '\\n';
  
     std::wcout << "locale with modified ctype:\\n";
     std::wistringstream s2(in);
     csv_whitespace* my_ws = new csv_whitespace;
     s2.imbue(std::locale(s2.getloc(), my_ws));
     while (s2 >> token)
         std::wcout << "  " << token << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 default locale:
   Column
   1,Column
   2,Column
   3
   123,456,789
 locale with modified ctype:
   Column 1
   Column 2
   Column 3
   123
   456
   789
