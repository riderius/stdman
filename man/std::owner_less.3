   struct owner_less<void>;

   std::owner_less<void> is a specialization of std::owner_less with parameter types
   deduced.

   bool operator()( const std::weak_ptr<T>& lhs,                     \fI(since C++17)\fP

                    const std::weak_ptr<U>& rhs ) const noexcept;

   Compares lhs and rhs using owner-based semantics. Effectively calls
   lhs.owner_before(rhs).

   The ordering is strict weak ordering relation.

   lhs and rhs are equivalent only if they are both empty or share ownership.

.SH Parameters

   lhs, rhs - shared-ownership pointers to compare

.SH Return value

   true if lhs is less than rhs as determined by the owner-based ordering.
