.SH NAME
std::shared_ptr::owner_hash \- std::shared_ptr::owner_hash

.SH Synopsis
   std::size_t owner_hash() const noexcept;  (since C++26)

   Returns an unspecified value such that for any object other where owner_equal(other)
   is true, owner_hash() == other.owner_hash() is true.

   This hashing is used to make shared and weak pointers usable as keys in unordered
   associative containers, typically through std::owner_hash.

.SH Return value

   A value that is identical for any std::shared_ptr or std::weak_ptr object sharing
   the same ownership.
