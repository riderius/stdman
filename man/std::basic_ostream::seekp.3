.SH NAME
std::basic_ostream::seekp \- std::basic_ostream::seekp

.SH Synopsis
   basic_ostream& seekp( pos_type pos );                             \fB(1)\fP
   basic_ostream& seekp( off_type off, std::ios_base::seekdir dir ); \fB(2)\fP

   Sets the output position indicator of the current associated streambuf object.

   Behaves as UnformattedOutputFunction (except without actually          \fI(since C++11)\fP
   performing output). After constructing and checking the sentry object,

   1) if fail() != true, sets the output position indicator to absolute (relative to
   the beginning of the file) value pos by calling rdbuf()->pubseekpos(pos,
   std::ios_base::out). In case of failure, calls setstate(std::ios_base::failbit).
   2) if fail() != true, sets the output position indicator to offset off relative to
   dir by calling rdbuf()->pubseekoff(off, dir, std::ios_base::out). In case of
   failure, calls setstate(std::ios_base::failbit).

.SH Parameters

   pos - absolute position to set the output position indicator to
   off - relative position (positive or negative) to set the output position indicator
         to
         defines base position to apply the relative offset to. It can be one of the
         following constants:

   dir - Constant Explanation
         beg      the beginning of a stream
         end      the ending of a stream
         cur      the current position of stream position indicator

.SH Return value

   *this

.SH Exceptions

   1,2) May throw std::ios_base::failure in case of failure, if exceptions() & failbit
   != 0.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <sstream>
  
 int main()
 {
     std::ostringstream os("hello, world");
     os.seekp(7);
     os << 'W';
     os.seekp(0, std::ios_base::end);
     os << '!';
     os.seekp(0);
     os << 'H';
     std::cout << os.str() << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 Hello, World!

   Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to
   previously published C++ standards.

      DR    Applied to         Behavior as published              Correct behavior
   LWG 129  C++98      there was no way to indicate a failure sets failbit on failure
   LWG 136  C++98      seekp could set the input stream       only sets the output
                                                              stream
   LWG 537  C++98      1. the type of pos was pos_type&       1. corrected to pos_type
                       2. the type of off was off_type&       2. corrected to off_type
   LWG 2341 C++98      the resolution of LWG issue 129 for    restored
                       overload \fB(2)\fP was removed
