.SH Synopsis
   poisson_distribution() : poisson_distribution(1.0) {}      \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   explicit poisson_distribution( double mean );              \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   explicit poisson_distribution( const param_type& params ); \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Constructs a new distribution object.

   1) Uses 1.0 as the distribution parameter.
   2) Uses mean as the distribution parameter.
   3) Uses params as the distribution parameter.

.SH Parameters

   mean   - the Î¼ distribution parameter (the mean of the distribution)
   params - the distribution parameter set

.SH Notes

   Requires that 0 < mean.
