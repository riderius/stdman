   Assigns new values to the contents.

   1,2) Assigns cx.real() and cx.imag() to the real and the imaginary parts of the
   complex number respectively.
   The copy assignment operator \fB(1)\fP is trivial when T is a floating-point type.
   (since C++23)
   3) Assigns x to the real part of the complex number. Imaginary part is set to zero.

.SH Parameters

   x  - value to assign
   cx - complex value to assign

.SH Return value

   *this

.SH Notes

   The copy assignment operator is required to be trivial since C++23, but
   implementations generally make it trivial in all modes.
