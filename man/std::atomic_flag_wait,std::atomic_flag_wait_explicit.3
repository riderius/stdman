                                   bool old, std::memory_order order  \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP
   ) noexcept;
   void atomic_flag_wait_explicit( const volatile atomic_flag*
   object,                                                            \fB(4)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP
                                   bool old, std::memory_order order
   ) noexcept;

   Performs atomic waiting operations.

   Compares object->test(std::memory_order_seq_cst) or object->test(order) with old,
   and if they are equal then blocks until *object is notified by
   std::atomic_flag::notify_one() or std::atomic_flag::notify_all() (or the thread is
   unblocked spuriously). This is repeated until the values compare unequal.

   1,2) The memory synchronization order is std::memory_order_seq_cst.
   3,4) The memory synchronization order is order.
   If order is one of std::memory_order_release and std::memory_order_acq_rel, the
   behavior is undefined.

   These functions are guaranteed to return only if value has changed, even if
   underlying implementation unblocks spuriously.

.SH Parameters

   object - pointer to the atomic flag to check and wait on
   old    - the value to check the atomic flag no longer contains
   order  - the memory synchronization ordering

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Notes

   This form of change-detection is often more efficient than simple polling or pure
   spinlocks.

   Due to the ABA problem, transient changes from old to another value and back to old
   might be missed, and not unblock.
