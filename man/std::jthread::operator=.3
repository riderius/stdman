.SH NAME
std::jthread::operator= \- std::jthread::operator=

.SH Synopsis
   std::jthread& operator=( std::jthread&& other ) noexcept;  \fI(since C++20)\fP

   If *this still has an associated running thread (i.e. joinable() == true), calls
   request_stop() followed by join(). Assigns the state of other to *this and sets
   other to a default constructed state.

   After this call, this->get_id() is equal to the value of other.get_id() prior to the
   call and the associated stop-state is also moved, and other no longer represents a
   thread of execution nor has any stop-state.

.SH Parameters

   other - another jthread object to assign to this jthread object

.SH Return value

   *this
