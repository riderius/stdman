.SH Synopsis
   std::stop_token& operator=( const std::stop_token& other )         \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP
   noexcept;
   std::stop_token& operator=( std::stop_token&& other ) noexcept;    \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Replaces the associated stop-state with that of other.

   1) Copy-assigns the associated stop-state of other to that of *this. Equivalent to
   stop_token(other).swap(*this).
   2) Move-assigns the associated stop-state of other to that of *this. After the
   assignment, *this contains the previous associated stop-state of other, and other
   has no associated stop-state. Equivalent to
   stop_token(std::move(other)).swap(*this).

.SH Parameters

   other - another stop_token object to share the stop-state with to or acquire the
           stop-state from
