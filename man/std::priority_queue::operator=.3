.SH NAME
std::priority_queue::operator= \- std::priority_queue::operator=

.SH Synopsis
   priority_queue& operator=( const priority_queue& other ); \fB(1)\fP (implicitly declared)
   priority_queue& operator=( priority_queue&& other );      \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
                                                                 (implicitly declared)

   Replaces the contents of the container adaptor with the contents of given argument.

   1) Copy assignment operator. Replaces the contents with a copy of the contents of
   other. Effectively calls c = other.c; comp = other.comp;.
   2) Move assignment operator. Replaces the contents with those of other using move
   semantics. Effectively calls c = std::move(other.c); comp = std::move(other.comp);.

.SH Parameters

   other - another container adaptor to be used as source

.SH Return value

   *this

.SH Complexity

   1,2) Equivalent to that of operator= of the underlying container.
