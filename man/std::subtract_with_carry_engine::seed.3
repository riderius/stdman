.SH NAME
std::subtract_with_carry_engine::seed \- std::subtract_with_carry_engine::seed

.SH Synopsis
   void seed( result_type value = 0u ); \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   template< class SeedSeq >            \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   void seed( SeedSeq& seq );

   Sets the state of the random-number engine.

   1) Right after the state is set, *this == std::subtract_with_carry_engine(value) is
   true.
   2) Right after the state is set, *this == std::subtract_with_carry_engine(seq) is
   true.

.SH Parameters

   value - seed value to use to set the state
   seq   - seed sequence to use to set the state

.SH Exceptions

   Throws nothing.

.SH Complexity

   1) Same as std::subtract_with_carry_engine(value).
   2) Same as std::subtract_with_carry_engine(seq).
