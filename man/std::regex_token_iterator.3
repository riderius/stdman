   > class regex_token_iterator

   std::regex_token_iterator is a read-only LegacyForwardIterator that accesses the
   individual sub-matches of every match of a regular expression within the underlying
   character sequence. It can also be used to access the parts of the sequence that
   were not matched by the given regular expression (e.g. as a tokenizer).

   On construction, it constructs an std::regex_iterator and on every increment it
   steps through the requested sub-matches from the current match_results, incrementing
   the underlying std::regex_iterator when incrementing away from the last submatch.

   The default-constructed std::regex_token_iterator is the end-of-sequence iterator.
   When a valid std::regex_token_iterator is incremented after reaching the last
   submatch of the last match, it becomes equal to the end-of-sequence iterator.
   Dereferencing or incrementing it further invokes undefined behavior.

   Just before becoming the end-of-sequence iterator, a std::regex_token_iterator may
   become a suffix iterator, if the index -1 (non-matched fragment) appears in the list
   of the requested submatch indices. Such iterator, if dereferenced, returns a
   match_results corresponding to the sequence of characters between the last match and
   the end of sequence.

   A typical implementation of std::regex_token_iterator holds the underlying
   std::regex_iterator, a container (e.g. std::vector<int>) of the requested submatch
   indices, the internal counter equal to the index of the submatch, a pointer to
   std::sub_match, pointing at the current submatch of the current match, and a
   std::match_results object containing the last non-matched character sequence (used
   in tokenizer mode).

.SH Type requirements

   -
   BidirIt must meet the requirements of LegacyBidirectionalIterator.

.SH Specializations

   Several specializations for common character sequence types are defined:

   operator++(int)       \fI(public member function)\fP 

.SH Notes

   It is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that the std::basic_regex object
   passed to the iterator's constructor outlives the iterator. Because the iterator
   stores a std::regex_iterator which stores a pointer to the regex, incrementing the
   iterator after the regex was destroyed results in undefined behavior.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <algorithm>
 #include <fstream>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <iterator>
 #include <regex>
  
 int main()
 {
     // Tokenization (non-matched fragments)
     // Note that regex is matched only two times; when the third value is obtained
     // the iterator is a suffix iterator.
     const std::string text = "Quick brown fox.";
     const std::regex ws_re("\\\\s+"); // whitespace
     std::copy(std::sregex_token_iterator(text.begin(), text.end(), ws_re, -1),
               std::sregex_token_iterator(),
               std::ostream_iterator<std::string>(std::cout, "\\n"));
  
     std::cout << '\\n';
  
     // Iterating the first submatches
     const std::string html = R"(<p><a href="http://google.com">google</a> )"
                              R"(< a HREF ="http://cppreference.com">cppreference</a>\\n</p>)";
     const std::regex url_re(R"!!(<\\s*A\\s+[^>]*href\\s*=\\s*"([^"]*)")!!", std::regex::icase);
     std::copy(std::sregex_token_iterator(html.begin(), html.end(), url_re, 1),
               std::sregex_token_iterator(),
               std::ostream_iterator<std::string>(std::cout, "\\n"));
 }

.SH Output:

 Quick

   Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to
   previously published C++ standards.

      DR     Applied to          Behavior as published             Correct behavior
   LWG 3698             regex_token_iterator was a
   (P2770R0) C++20      forward_iterator                        made input_iterator^[1]
                        while being a stashing iterator

    1. â†‘ iterator_category was unchanged by the resolution, because changing it to
       std::input_iterator_tag might break too much existing code.
