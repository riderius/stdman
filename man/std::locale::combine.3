.SH NAME
std::locale::combine \- std::locale::combine

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   template< class Facet >
   locale combine( const locale& other ) const;

   Constructs a locale object which is a copy of *this except for the facet of type
   Facet, which is copied from other.

   The program is ill-formed if Facet is not a facet or it is a volatile-qualified
   facet.

.SH Return value

   The new, nameless, locale.

.SH Exceptions

   std::runtime_error if other does not implement Facet.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <locale>
  
 int main()
 {
     const double number = 1000.25;
     std::cout << "\\"C\\" locale: " << number << '\\n';
     std::locale loc = std::locale()
         .combine<std::numpunct<char>>(std::locale("en_US.UTF8"));
     std::cout.imbue(loc);
     std::cout << "\\"C\\" locale with en_US numpunct: " << number << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 "C" locale: 1000.25
 "C" locale with en_US numpunct: 1,000.25
