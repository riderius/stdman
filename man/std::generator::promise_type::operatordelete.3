.SH NAME
std::generator::promise_type::operatordelete \- std::generator::promise_type::operatordelete

.SH Synopsis
   void operator delete( void* ptr, std::size_t n ) noexcept;  (since C++23)

   Deallocates the storage pointed to by ptr using an allocator equivalent to that used
   to allocate this memory.

   The ptr passed to this function must be the one returned from an invocation of one
   of the operator new overloads with a size argument equal to n. Otherwise the
   behavior is undefined.

.SH Parameters

   ptr - a pointer obtained from the previous call to operator new
   n   - the size of the storage to be deallocated

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP
