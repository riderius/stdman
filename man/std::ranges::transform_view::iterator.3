.SH NAME
std::ranges::transform_view::iterator \- std::ranges::transform_view::iterator

.SH Synopsis
   template< bool Const >  \fI(since C++20)\fP
   class /*iterator*/      (exposition only*)

   The return type of transform_view::begin, and of transform_view::end when the
   underlying view is a common_range.

   The type /*iterator*/<true> is returned by the const-qualified overloads. The type
   /*iterator*/<false> is returned by the non-const-qualified overloads.

   Parent (private)  ranges::transform_view<V, F>.

   Base (private)    const V if Const is true, otherwise V.

                     bidirectional_range,
                     std::forward_iterator_tag if Base models forward_range,
                     std::input_iterator_tag otherwise.
                     Not defined if Base does not model forward_range.
                     Otherwise, if std::invoke_result_t<F&,
                     ranges::range_reference_t<Base>> is not a reference,
                     std::input_iterator_tag.

                     Else, let C be
                     std::iterator_traits<ranges::iterator_t<Base>>::iterator_category.
                     If C is std::contiguous_iterator_tag, the type is
                     std::random_access_iterator_tag; otherwise, the type is C.
