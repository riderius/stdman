.SH NAME
std::latch::count_down \- std::latch::count_down

.SH Synopsis
   void count_down( std::ptrdiff_t n = 1 );  \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Atomically decrements the internal counter by n without blocking the caller.

   If n is greater than the value of the internal counter or is negative, the behavior
   is undefined.

   This operation strongly happens-before all calls that are unblocked on this latch.

.SH Parameters

   n - the value by which the internal counter is decreased

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

   Throws std::system_error with an error code allowed for mutex types on error.
