.SH NAME
std::atomic_ref::fetch_and \- std::atomic_ref::fetch_and

.SH Synopsis
   member only of atomic_ref<Integral> specializations
   T fetch_and( T arg,
                std::memory_order order = std::memory_order_seq_cst )     \fI(since C++20)\fP
   const noexcept;

   Atomically replaces the current value of the referenced object with the result of
   bitwise AND of the value and arg. This operation is a read-modify-write operation.
   Memory is affected according to the value of order.

.SH Parameters

   arg   - the other argument of bitwise AND
   order - memory order constraints to enforce

.SH Return value

   The value of the referenced object, immediately preceding the effects of this
   function.
