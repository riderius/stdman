.SH NAME
std::stacktrace_entry::source_line \- std::stacktrace_entry::source_line

.SH Synopsis
   std::uint_least32_t source_line() const;  (since C++23)

   Returns a 1-based line number that lexically relates to the evaluation represented
   by *this, or 0 on failure other than allocation failure, e.g. when *this is empty.

   Either source_file returns the presumed source file name and source_line returns the
   presumed line number, or source_file returns the actual source file name and
   source_line returns the actual line number.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   The line number specified above on success, 0 on failure other than allocation
   failure.

.SH Exceptions

   Throws std::bad_alloc if memory for the internal data structures cannot be
   allocated.

.SH Notes

   The presumed line number is what the predefined macro __LINE__ expands to, and can
   be changed by the #line directive.

    This section is incomplete
    Reason: definition of "actual line number" is missing (LWG issue 3507)

   This function is not required to be noexcept because getting source line requires
   allocation on some platforms.
