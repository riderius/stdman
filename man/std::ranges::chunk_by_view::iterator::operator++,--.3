.SH Synopsis
   constexpr /*iterator*/& operator++();                              \fB(1)\fP (since C++23)
   constexpr /*iterator*/ operator++(int);                            \fB(2)\fP (since C++23)
   constexpr /*iterator*/& operator--() requires                      \fB(3)\fP (since C++23)
   ranges::bidirectional_range<V>;
   constexpr /*iterator*/ operator--(int) requires                    \fB(4)\fP (since C++23)
   ranges::bidirectional_range<V>;

   Increments or decrements the iterator.

   Let parent_, current_, and next_ be the appropriate underlying (exposition-only)
   data-members of iterator.

   Let find-next and find-prev be appropriate (exposition-only) member functions of
   ranges::chunk_by_view.

   1) Equivalent to:

 current_ = next_;
 next_ = parent_->/*find-next*/(current_);
 return *this;

   The behavior is undefined if before the call to this operator current_ is equal to
   next_.
   2) Equivalent to: auto tmp = *this; ++*this; return tmp;
   3) Equivalent to:

 next_ = current_;
 current_ = parent_->/*find-prev*/(next_);
 return *this;

   4) Equivalent to: auto tmp = *this; --*this; return tmp;

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   1,3) *this
   2,4) a copy of *this that was made before the change.
