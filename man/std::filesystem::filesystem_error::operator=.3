.SH NAME
std::filesystem::filesystem_error::operator= \- std::filesystem::filesystem_error::operator=

.SH Synopsis
   filesystem_error& operator=( const filesystem_error& other )           \fI(since C++17)\fP
   noexcept;

   Assigns the contents with those of other. If *this and other both have dynamic type
   std::filesystem::filesystem_error then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0 after
   assignment.

.SH Parameters

   other - another filesystem_error object to assign with

.SH Return value

   *this

.SH Notes

   Typical implementations store path objects referenced by path1() and path2() in a
   reference-counted storage. As a result, *this and other usually share their path
   objects after assignment.
