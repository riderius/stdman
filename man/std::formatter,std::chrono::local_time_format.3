   Specialization of std::formatter that defines formatting rules for a
   std::chrono::local_time.

   1) If %Z, %z or a modified variant of %z is used, a std::format_error is thrown.
   2-4) The local_time_format function returns a value of unspecified type that holds
   the local time, offset, and time zone abbreviation.
   When an object f of this unspecified type is formatted, if %Z is used, it is
   replaced with *f.abbrev widened to CharT if f.abbrev is not null; otherwise a
   std::format_error is thrown. If %z or a modified variant thereof is used, an offset
   of *f.offset_sec will be formatted if f.offset_sec is not null; otherwise a
   std::format_error is thrown.

   std::formatter is usually not directly accessed, but is used through formatting
   functions.

   Format specification

   The format specification has the form

   fill-and-align (optional) width (optional) precision (optional) L(optional)
   chrono-spec (optional)

   fill-and-align, width, and precision have the same meaning as in standard format
   specification. precision is valid only for std::chrono::duration types where the
   representation type Rep is a floating-point type, otherwise std::format_error is
   thrown.

   The locale used for formatting is determined as follows:

     * the default "C" locale if L is not present in the format specification,
     * otherwise, the locale denoted by the std::locale passed to the formatting
       function, if any,
     * otherwise (L is present but no std::locale is passed to the formatting
       function), the global locale.

   The chrono-spec consists of one or more conversion specifiers and ordinary
   characters (other than {, }, and %). A chrono-spec must start with a conversion
   specifier. All ordinary characters are written to the output without modification.
   Each unmodified conversion specifier begins with a % character followed by a
   character that determines the behavior of the specifier. Some conversion specifiers
   have a modified form in which an E or O modifier character is inserted after the %
   character. Each conversion specifier is replaced by appropriate characters in the
   output as described below.

   If the chrono-spec is empty, the chrono object is formatted as if by streaming it to
   an object os of type std::basic_ostringstream<CharT> with the formatting locale (one
   of std::locale::classic(), the passed std::locale object, and std::locale::global())
   imbued and copying os.str() to the output buffer with additional padding and
   adjustments as per format specifiers.

   The following format specifiers are available:

   Conversion                               Explanation
   specifier
       %%     Writes a literal % character.

              Writes the day of the year as a decimal number (January 1 is 001). If
       %j     the result is less than three digits, it is left-padded with 0 to three
              digits.
              Writes the week number of the year as a decimal number. The first Sunday
              of the year is the first day of week 01. Days of the same year prior to
       %U     that are in week 00. If the result is a single digit, it is prefixed
      %OU     with 0.

              The modified command %OU writes the locale's alternative representation.
              Writes the week number of the year as a decimal number. The first Monday
              of the year is the first day of week 01. Days of the same year prior to
       %W     that are in week 00. If the result is a single digit, it is prefixed
      %OW     with 0.

              The modified command %OW writes the locale's alternative representation.
                                           Date
       %D     Equivalent to "%m/%d/%y".

              Writes the hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number. If the result is a
       %H     single digit, it is prefixed with 0.
      %OH
              The modified command %OH writes the locale's alternative representation.
              Writes the hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number. If the result is a
       %I     single digit, it is prefixed with 0.
      %OI
              The modified command %OI writes the locale's alternative representation.

      %OM
              The modified command %OM writes the locale's alternative representation.
              Writes the second as a decimal number. If the number of seconds is less
              than 10, the result is prefixed with 0.

              If the precision of the input cannot be exactly represented with
       %S     seconds, then the format is a decimal floating-point number with a fixed
      %OS     format and a precision matching that of the precision of the input (or
              to a microseconds precision if the conversion to floating-point decimal
              seconds cannot be made within 18 fractional digits). The character for
              the decimal point is localized according to the locale.

              The modified command %OS writes the locale's alternative representation.
       %p     Writes the locale's equivalent of the AM/PM designations associated with
              a 12-hour clock.
       %R     Equivalent to "%H:%M".

              Writes the offset from UTC in the ISO 8601 format. For example -0430
       %z     refers to 4 hours 30 minutes behind UTC. If the offset is zero, +0000 is
      %Ez     used.
      %Oz
              The modified commands %Ez and %Oz insert a : between the hours and
              minutes (e.g., -04:30).
       %Z     Writes the time zone abbreviation.
.SH Miscellaneous

   The following specifiers are recognized, but will cause std::format_error to be
