.SH NAME
std::mul_sat \- std::mul_sat

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <numeric>
   template< class T >                        (since C++26)
   constexpr T mul_sat( T x, T y ) noexcept;

   Computes the saturating multiplication x × y. This operation (unlike built-in
   arithmetic operations on integers) behaves as-if it is a mathematical operation with
   an infinite range. Let q denote the result of such operation. Returns:

     * q, if q is representable as a value of type T. Otherwise,
     * the largest or smallest value of type T, whichever is closer to the q.

   This overload participates in overload resolution only if T is an integer type, that
   is: signed char, short, int, long, long long, an extended signed integer type, or an
   unsigned version of such types. In particular, T must not be (possibly cv-qualified)
   bool, char, wchar_t, char8_t, char16_t, and char32_t, as these types are not
   intended for arithmetic.

.SH Parameters

   x, y - integer values

.SH Return value

   Saturated x × y.

.SH Exceptions

   Throws no exceptions.

.SH Notes

   Unlike the built-in arithmetic operators on integers, the integral promotion does
   not apply to the x and y arguments.

   If two arguments of different type are passed, the call fails to compile, i.e. the
   behavior relative to template argument deduction is the same as for std::min or
   std::max.

   Most modern hardware architectures have efficient support for saturation arithmetic
   on SIMD vectors, including SSE2 for x86 and NEON for ARM.
