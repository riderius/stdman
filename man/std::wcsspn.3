.SH NAME
std::wcsspn \- std::wcsspn

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cwchar>
   size_t wcsspn( const wchar_t* dest, const wchar_t* src );

   Returns the length of the maximum initial segment of the wide string pointed to by
   dest, that consists of only the characters found in wide string pointed to by src.

.SH Parameters

   dest - pointer to the null-terminated wide string to be analyzed
   src  - pointer to the null-terminated wide string that contains the characters to
          search for

.SH Return value

   The length of the maximum initial segment that contains only characters from wide
   string pointed to by src.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <cwchar>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <locale>
  
 int main()
 {
     wchar_t dest[] = L"白猫 黑狗 甲虫";
     const wchar_t src[] = L" 狗猫 白黑 ";
     const std::size_t len = std::wcsspn(dest, src);
     dest[len] = L'\\0'; // terminates the segment to print it out
  
     std::wcout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.utf8"));
     std::wcout << L"The length of maximum initial segment is " << len << L".\\n";
     std::wcout << L"The segment is \\"" << dest << L"\\".\\n";
 }

.SH Possible output:

 The length of maximum initial segment is 6.
 The segment is "白猫 黑狗 ".
