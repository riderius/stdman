       class BidirIt,

   > class regex_iterator

   std::regex_iterator is a read-only iterator that accesses the individual matches of
   a regular expression within the underlying character sequence. It meets the
   requirements of a LegacyForwardIterator, except that for dereferenceable values a
   and b with a == b, *a and *b will not be bound to the same object.

   On construction, and on every increment, it calls std::regex_search and remembers
   the result (that is, saves a copy of the std::match_results<BidirIt> value). The
   first object may be read when the iterator is constructed or when the first
   dereferencing is done. Otherwise, dereferencing only returns a copy of the most
   recently obtained regex match.

   The default-constructed std::regex_iterator is the end-of-sequence iterator. When a
   valid std::regex_iterator is incremented after reaching the last match
   (std::regex_search returns false), it becomes equal to the end-of-sequence iterator.
   Dereferencing or incrementing it further invokes undefined behavior.

   A typical implementation of std::regex_iterator holds the begin and the end
   iterators for the underlying sequence (two instances of BidirIt), a pointer to the
   regular expression (const regex_type*), the match flags
   (std::regex_constants::match_flag_type), and the current match
   (std::match_results<BidirIt>).

.SH Type requirements

   -
   BidirIt must meet the requirements of LegacyBidirectionalIterator.

.SH Specializations

   Several specializations for common character sequence types are defined:

   (implicitly declared) \fI(public member function)\fP

   (removed in C++20)
   operator*             accesses the current match
   operator->            \fI(public member function)\fP 
   operator++            advances the iterator to the next match
   operator++(int)       \fI(public member function)\fP 

.SH Notes

   It is the programmer's responsibility to ensure that the std::basic_regex object
   passed to the iterator's constructor outlives the iterator. Because the iterator
   stores a pointer to the regex, incrementing the iterator after the regex was
   destroyed accesses a dangling pointer.

   If the part of the regular expression that matched is just an assertion (^, $, \\b,
   \\B), the match stored in the iterator is a zero-length match, that is,
   match[0].first == match[0].second.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <iterator>
 #include <regex>
 #include <string>
  
 int main()
 {
     const std::string s = "Quick brown fox.";
  
     std::regex words_regex("[^\\\\s]+");
     auto words_begin = std::sregex_iterator(s.begin(), s.end(), words_regex);
     auto words_end = std::sregex_iterator();
  
     std::cout << "Found " << std::distance(words_begin, words_end) << " words:\\n";
  
     for (std::sregex_iterator i = words_begin; i != words_end; ++i)
     {
         std::smatch match = *i;
         std::string match_str = match.str();
         std::cout << match_str << '\\n';
     }
 }

.SH Output:

 Found 3 words:
 Quick
 brown
 fox.

   Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to
   previously published C++ standards.

      DR     Applied to         Behavior as published            Correct behavior
   LWG 3698  C++20      regex_iterator was a forward_iterator made input_iterator^[1]
   (P2770R0)            while being a stashing iterator

    1. â†‘ iterator_category was unchanged by the resolution, because changing it to
       std::input_iterator_tag might break too much existing code.
