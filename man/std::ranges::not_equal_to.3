.SH NAME
std::ranges::not_equal_to \- std::ranges::not_equal_to

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <functional>
   struct not_equal_to;            \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Function object for performing comparisons. Deduces the parameter types of the
   function call operator from the arguments (but not the return type).

.SH Member functions

   operator() checks if the arguments are not equal
              \fI(public member function)\fP

std::ranges::not_equal_to::operator()

   template< class T, class U >
   constexpr bool operator()( T&& t, U&& u ) const;

   Equivalent to return !ranges::equal_to{}(std::forward<T>(t), std::forward<U>(u));.

   This overload participates in overload resolution only if
   std::equality_comparable_with<T, U> is satisfied.

.SH Notes

   Unlike std::not_equal_to, std::ranges::not_equal_to requires both == and != to be
   valid (via the equality_comparable_with constraint), and is entirely defined in
   terms of std::ranges::equal_to.
