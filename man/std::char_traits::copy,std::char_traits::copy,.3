.SH Synopsis
                             std::char_traits<char32_t>::copy

   static char_type*
       copy( char_type* dest, const char_type* src,             (constexpr since C++20)
   std::size_t count );

   Copies count characters from the character string pointed to by src to the character
   string pointed to by dest.

   If [dest, dest + count) and [src, src + count) overlap, the behavior is undefined.

   See CharTraits for the general requirements on character traits for X::copy.

.SH Parameters

   dest  - pointer to a character string to copy to
   src   - pointer to a character string to copy from
   count - the number of characters to copy

.SH Return value

   dest

.SH Exceptions

   Throws nothing.

.SH Complexity

   Linear in count.
