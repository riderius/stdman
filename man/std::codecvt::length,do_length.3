.SH NAME
std::codecvt::length,do_length \- std::codecvt::length,do_length

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <locale>
   public:

   int length( StateT& state, const ExternT* from, const ExternT* from_end,        \fB(1)\fP

               std::size_t max ) const;
   protected:

   virtual int do_length( StateT& state, const ExternT* from, const ExternT*       \fB(2)\fP
   from_end,

                          std::size_t max ) const;

   1) Public member function, calls the member function do_length of the most derived
   class.
   2) Attempts to convert the ExternT characters from the character array defined by
   [from, from_end), given initial conversion state state, to at most max InternT
   characters, and returns the number of ExternT characters that such conversion would
   consume. Modifies state as if by executing do_in(state, from, from_end, from, to, to
   + max, to) for some imaginary [to, to + max) output buffer.

.SH Return value

   The number of ExternT characters that would be consumed if converted by do_in()
   until either all from_end - from characters were consumed or max InternT characters
   were produced, or a conversion error occurred.

   The non-converting specialization std::codecvt<char, char, std::mbstate_t> returns
   std::min(max, from_end - from).

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <locale>
 #include <string>
  
 int main()
 {
     using facet_type = std::codecvt<char16_t, char, std::mbstate_t>;
  
     // narrow multibyte encoding
     std::string s = "z\\u00df\\u6c34\\U0001d10b"; // or u8"z√üÊ∞¥ùÑã"
               // or "\\x7a\\xc3\\x9f\\xe6\\xb0\\xb4\\xf0\\x9d\\x84\\x8b"
  
     std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.UTF-8");
     facet_type const& codecvt_facet = std::use_facet<facet_type>(std::locale());
     std::mbstate_t mb = std::mbstate_t();
     std::cout << "Only the first "
               << codecvt_facet.length(mb, s.data(), s.data() + s.size(), 2)
               << " bytes out of " << s.size() << " would be consumed"
                  " to produce the first 2 characters\\n";
 }

.SH Output:

 Only the first 3 bytes out of 10 would be consumed to produce the first 2 characters
