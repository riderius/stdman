.SH Synopsis
                             std::char_traits<char32_t>::move

   static char_type*
       move( char_type* dest, const char_type* src,             (constexpr since C++20)
   std::size_t count );

   Copies count characters from the character string pointed to by src to the character
   string pointed to by dest.

   Performs correctly even if the ranges [src, src + count) and [dest, dest + count)
   overlap.

   See CharTraits for the general requirements on character traits for X::move.

.SH Parameters

   dest  - pointer to a character string to copy to
   src   - pointer to a character string to copy from
   count - the number of characters to copy

.SH Return value

   dest

.SH Exceptions

   Throws nothing.

.SH Complexity

   Linear in count.

   Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to
   previously published C++ standards.

    DR   Applied to               Behavior as published               Correct behavior
                    the copy was guaranteed to perform correctly if
   LWG 7 C++98      src is in [dest, dest + count), but not the other also guaranteed
                    way round (i.e. dest is in [src, src + count))
