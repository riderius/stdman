.SH NAME
std::barrier::barrier \- std::barrier::barrier

.SH Synopsis
   constexpr explicit barrier( std::ptrdiff_t expected,
                               CompletionFunction f =                 \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP
   CompletionFunction());
   barrier( const barrier& ) = delete;                                \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP

   1) Sets the both initial expected count for each phase and the current expected
   count for the first phase to expected, initializes the completion function object
   with std::move(f), and then starts the first phase. The behavior is undefined if
   expected is negative or greater than max().
   2) Copy constructor is deleted. barrier is neither copyable nor movable.

.SH Parameters

   expected - initial value of the expected count
   f        - completion function object to be called on phase completion step

.SH Exceptions

   1) Any exception thrown by CompletionFunction's move constructor.

.SH Notes

   expected is permitted to be zero. However, calling any non-static member function
   other than the destructor on such barrier results in undefined behavior. In other
   words, such barrier can only be destroyed.
