.SH NAME
std::execution::ensure_started \- std::execution::ensure_started

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <execution>
   execution::sender auto ensure_started(

       execution::sender auto sender       (since C++26)

   );

.SH Parameters

   sender - input sender of which the stopped channel is mapped into err

.SH Return value

   Returns a sender which completes when the provided sender completes and sends values
   equivalent to those of the provided sender.

.SH Notes

     * Once ensure_started returns, it is known that the provided sender has been
       connected and start has been called on the resulting operation state. In other
       words, the work described by the provided sender has been submitted for
       execution on the appropriate execution resources.
     * If the returned sender is destroyed before execution::connect() is called, or if
       execution::connect() is called but the returned operation-state is destroyed
       before execution::start() is called, then a stop-request is sent to the eagerly
       launched operation and the operation is detached and will run to completion in
       the background.
     * In such a case, the operation's result will be discarded when it is eventually
       complete.
     * Note that the application will need to make sure that resources are kept alive
       in the case that the operation detaches (e.g. by holding a std::shared_ptr to
       those resources).
