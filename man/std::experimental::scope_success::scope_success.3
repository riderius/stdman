.SH Synopsis
   template< class Fn >
   explicit scope_success( Fn&& fn ) noexcept(/*see    \fB(1)\fP (library fundamentals TS v3)
   below*/);
   scope_success( scope_success&& other )              \fB(2)\fP (library fundamentals TS v3)
   noexcept(/*see below*/);
   scope_success( const scope_success& ) = delete;     \fB(3)\fP (library fundamentals TS v3)

   Creates a scope_success from a function, a function object or another scope_success.

   1) Initializes the exit function with a function or function object, and initializes
   the counter of uncaught exceptions as if with std::uncaught_exceptions(). The
   constructed scope_success is active.
   If Fn is not an lvalue reference type and std::is_nothrow_constructible_v<EF, Fn> is
   true, the stored EF is initialized with std::forward<Fn>(fn); otherwise it is
   initialized with fn.
   This overload participates in overload resolution only if
   std::is_same_v<std::remove_cvref_t<Fn>, scope_success> is false and
   std::is_constructible_v<EF, Fn> is true.
   The program is ill-formed if function call expression fn() is ill-formed.
   The behavior is undefined if calling fn() results in undefined behavior, even if fn
   has not been called.
   2) Move constructor. Initializes the stored EF with the one in other, and
   initializes the counter of uncaught exceptions with the one in other. The
   constructed scope_success is active if and only if other is active before the
   construction.
   If std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<EF> is true, initializes stored EF (denoted
   by exitfun) with std::forward<EF>(other.exitfun), otherwise initializes it with
   other.exitfun.
   After successful move construction, other.release() is called and other becomes
   inactive.
   This overload participates in overload resolution only if
   std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<EF> is true or std::is_copy_constructible_v<EF>
   is true.
   The behavior is undefined if
     * std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<EF> is true and EF does not meet the
       requirements of MoveConstructible, or
     * std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<EF> is false and EF does not meet the
       requirements of CopyConstructible.
   3) scope_success is not CopyConstructible.

.SH Parameters

   fn    - function or function object used for initializing the stored EF
   other - scope_success to move from

.SH Exceptions

   Any exception thrown during the initialization of the stored EF.
