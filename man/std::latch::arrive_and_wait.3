.SH Synopsis
   void arrive_and_wait( std::ptrdiff_t n = 1 );  \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Atomically decrements the internal counter by n and (if necessary) blocks the
   calling thread until the counter reaches zero. Equivalent to count_down(n); wait();.

   If n is greater than the value of the internal counter or is negative, the behavior
   is undefined.

.SH Parameters

   n - the value by which the internal counter is decreased

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

   Throws std::system_error with an error code allowed for mutex types on error.
