   Constructs the pseudo-random number engine.

   1) The default constructor.
   2) Constructs the engine with a seed value value. Given \\(2^w\\)2w
   as p, the engine's initial state is determined as follows:
    1. Sets \\(X_{-n}\\)X
       -n to value % p.
    2. For each integer i in [i - n, -1], sets \\(X_i\\)X
       i to \\([f \\cdot (X_{i-1}\\ \\mathsf{xor}\\ (X_{i-1}\\ \\mathsf{rshift}\\ (w-2)))+i\\mod
       n]\\mod p\\)[f·(X
       i-1 xor (X
       i-1 rshift (w-2)))+i mod n] mod p, where \\(\\mathsf{xor}\\)xor and
       \\(\\mathsf{rshift}\\)rshift stand for built-in bitwise XOR and bitwise right-shift
       respectively.
   3) Constructs the engine with a seed sequence seq. Given std::size_t(w / 32) + 1 as
   k, the engine's initial state is determined as follows:
    1. Creates an invented array object a of length n * k.
    2. Calls seq.generate(a + 0, a + n * k).
    3. For each integer i in [-n, -1], sets \\(X_{i}\\)X
       i to \\((\\sum^{k-1}_{j=0} a_{k(i+n)+j} \\cdot 2^{32j}) \\mod 2^w\\)(∑k-1
       j=0 a
       k(i+n)+j·232j
       ) mod 2w
       .
    4. If the most significant w − r bits of \\(X_{-n}\\)X
       -n are zero, and if each of the other resulting \\(X_{i}\\)X
       i is 0, changes \\(X_{-n}\\)X
       -n to \\(2^{w-1}\\)2w-1
       .
   This overload participates in overload resolution only if SeedSeq meets the
   requirements of SeedSequence.
   4) The copy constructor. Upon construction, *this == other is true.

.SH Parameters

   value - seed value to use in the initialization of the internal state
   seq   - seed sequence to use in the initialization of the internal state

.SH Complexity

   1,2) \\(\\small{O(n)}\\)O(n).
   3) Same as the complexity of the seq.generate call.
   4) \\(\\small{O(n)}\\)O(n).
