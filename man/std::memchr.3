.TH std::memchr 3 "2024.06.10" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::memchr \- std::memchr

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <cstring>
   const void* memchr( const void* ptr, int ch, std::size_t count );
   void* memchr(       void* ptr, int ch, std::size_t count );

   Converts ch to unsigned char and locates the first occurrence of that value in the
   initial count bytes (each interpreted as unsigned char) of the object pointed to by
   ptr.

   This function behaves as if it reads the bytes sequentially and stops
   as soon as a matching bytes is found: if the array pointed to by ptr   \fI(since C++17)\fP
   is smaller than count, but the match is found within the array, the
   behavior is well-defined.

.SH Parameters

   ptr   - pointer to the object to be examined
   ch    - byte to search for
   count - max number of bytes to examine

.SH Return value

   Pointer to the location of the byte, or a null pointer if no such byte is found.

.SH Example

   Search an array of characters.

   
// Run this code

 #include <cstring>
 #include <iostream>
  
 int main()
 {
     char arr[] = {'a', '\\0', 'a', 'A', 'a', 'a', 'A', 'a'};
     char *pc = (char*) std::memchr(arr, 'A', sizeof arr);
     if (pc != nullptr)
         std::cout << "search character found\\n";
     else
         std::cout << "search character not found\\n";
 }

.SH Output:

 search character found
