.SH NAME
std::defer_lock_t,std::try_to_lock_t,std::adopt_lock_t \- std::defer_lock_t,std::try_to_lock_t,std::adopt_lock_t

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <mutex>
   struct defer_lock_t { explicit defer_lock_t() = default; };

   struct try_to_lock_t { explicit try_to_lock_t() = default; };  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   struct adopt_lock_t { explicit adopt_lock_t() = default; };

   std::defer_lock_t, std::try_to_lock_t and std::adopt_lock_t are empty class tag
   types used to specify locking strategy for std::unique_lock and std::shared_lock.

   Type          Effect(s)
   defer_lock_t  do not acquire ownership of the mutex
   try_to_lock_t try to acquire ownership of the mutex without blocking
   adopt_lock_t  assume the calling thread already has ownership of the mutex

.SH Example

   
   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <mutex>
 #include <thread>
  
 struct bank_account
 {
     explicit bank_account(int balance) : balance{balance} {}
     int balance;
     std::mutex m;
 };
  
 void transfer(bank_account& from, bank_account& to, int amount)
 {
     if (&from == &to) // avoid deadlock in case of self transfer
         return;
  
     // lock both mutexes without deadlock
     std::lock(from.m, to.m);
     // make sure both already-locked mutexes are unlocked at the end of scope
     std::lock_guard lock1{from.m, std::adopt_lock};
     std::lock_guard lock2{to.m, std::adopt_lock};
  
 // equivalent approach:
 //  std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock1{from.m, std::defer_lock};
 //  std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock2{to.m, std::defer_lock};
 //  std::lock(lock1, lock2);
  
     from.balance -= amount;
     to.balance += amount;
 }
  
 int main()
 {
     bank_account my_account{100};
     bank_account your_account{50};
  
     std::thread t1{transfer, std::ref(my_account), std::ref(your_account), 10};
     std::thread t2{transfer, std::ref(your_account), std::ref(my_account), 5};
  
     t1.join();
     t2.join();
  
     std::cout << "my_account.balance = " << my_account.balance << "\\n"
                  "your_account.balance = " << your_account.balance << '\\n';
 }

.SH Output:

 my_account.balance = 95
 your_account.balance = 55

   Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to
   previously published C++ standards.

      DR    Applied to              Behavior as published              Correct behavior
   LWG 2510 C++11      the default constructors were non-explicit,     made explicit
                       which could lead to ambiguity
