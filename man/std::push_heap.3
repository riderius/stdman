.SH NAME
std::push_heap \- std::push_heap

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <algorithm>
   template< class RandomIt >                               \fB(1)\fP (constexpr since C++20)
   void push_heap( RandomIt first, RandomIt last );
   template< class RandomIt, class Compare >
   void push_heap( RandomIt first, RandomIt last, Compare   \fB(2)\fP (constexpr since C++20)
   comp );

   Inserts the element at the position last - 1 into the heap [first, last - 1). The
   heap after the insertion will be [first, last).

   1) The heap is with respect to
   operator<
   \fI(until C++20)\fP
   std::less{}
   \fI(since C++20)\fP.
   2) The heap is with respect to comp.

   If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is undefined:

     * [first, last - 1) is not a heap.

     * The type of *first is not Swappable.           \fI(until C++11)\fP
     * RandomIt is not ValueSwappable.
     * The type of *first is not MoveConstructible.   \fI(since C++11)\fP
     * The type of *first is not MoveAssignable.

.SH Parameters

   first, last -  the range indicating the heap after the insertion
                  comparison function object (i.e. an object that satisfies the
                  requirements of Compare) which returns true if the first argument is
                  less than the second.

                  The signature of the comparison function should be equivalent to the
                  following:

                  bool cmp(const Type1& a, const Type2& b);
   comp        -
                  While the signature does not need to have const&, the function must
                  not modify the objects passed to it and must be able to accept all
                  values of type (possibly const) Type1 and Type2 regardless of value
                  category (thus, Type1& is not allowed
                  , nor is Type1 unless for Type1 a move is equivalent to a copy
                  \fI(since C++11)\fP).
                  The types Type1 and Type2 must be such that an object of type
                  RandomIt can be dereferenced and then implicitly converted to both of
                  them.
.SH Type requirements
   -
   RandomIt must meet the requirements of LegacyRandomAccessIterator.
   -
   Compare must meet the requirements of Compare.

.SH Complexity

   Given \\(\\scriptsize N\\)N as std::distance(first, last):

   1) At most \\(\\scriptsize \\log(N)\\)log(N) comparisons using
   operator<
   \fI(until C++20)\fP
   std::less{}
   \fI(since C++20)\fP.
   2) At most \\(\\scriptsize \\log(N)\\)log(N) applications of the comparison function
   comp.

.SH Example

   
// Run this code

 #include <algorithm>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <string_view>
 #include <vector>
  
 void println(std::string_view rem, const std::vector<int>& v)
 {
     std::cout << rem;
     for (int e : v)
         std::cout << e << ' ';
     std::cout << '\\n';
 }
  
 int main()
 {
     std::vector<int> v{3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9};
  
     std::make_heap(v.begin(), v.end());
     println("after make_heap: ", v);
  
     v.push_back(6);
     println("after push_back: ", v);
  
     std::push_heap(v.begin(), v.end());
     println("after push_heap: ", v);
 }

.SH Output:

 after make_heap: 9 5 4 1 1 3
 after push_back: 9 5 4 1 1 3 6
 after push_heap: 9 5 6 1 1 3 4
