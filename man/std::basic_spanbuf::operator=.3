.SH NAME
std::basic_spanbuf::operator= \- std::basic_spanbuf::operator=

.SH Synopsis
   basic_spanbuf& operator=( basic_spanbuf&& rhs );          \fB(1)\fP (since C++23)
   basic_spanbuf& operator( const basic_spanbuf& ) = delete; \fB(2)\fP (since C++23)

   1) Move assignment operator. Equivalent to auto tmp{std::move(rhs)};
   this->swap(tmp); return *this;. After move assignment, *this holds the state rhs
   held before move assignment. It is implementation-defined whether rhs still hold the
   underlying buffer after move assignment.
   2) The copy assignment operator is deleted; basic_spanbuf is not CopyAssignable.

.SH Parameters

   rhs - another basic_spanbuf that will be moved from

.SH Return value

   *this

.SH Exceptions

   May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
