.SH NAME
std::stacktrace_entry::description \- std::stacktrace_entry::description

.SH Synopsis
   std::string description() const;  (since C++23)

   Returns a description of the evaluation represented by *this on success, or an empty
   string on failure other than allocation failure, e.g. when *this is empty.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   A description of the represented evaluation on success, an empty string on failure
   other than allocation failure.

.SH Exceptions

   Throws std::bad_alloc if memory for the internal data structures or the resulting
   string cannot be allocated.

.SH Notes

   Custom allocators support for this function is not provided, because the
   implementations usually require platform specific allocations, system calls and a
   lot of CPU intensive work, while a custom allocator does not provide benefits for
   this function as the platform specific operations take an order of magnitude more
   time than the allocation.
