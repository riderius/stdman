.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/memory_resource>
   class monotonic_buffer_resource : public memory_resource;  (library fundamentals TS)

   The class std::experimental::pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource is a special-purpose
   memory resource class that releases the allocated memory only when the resource is
   destroyed. It is intended for very fast memory allocations in situations where
   memory is used to build up a few objects and then is released all at once.

   monotonic_buffer_resource can be constructed with an initial buffer. If there is no
   initial buffer, or if the buffer is exhausted, additional buffers are obtained from
   an upstream memory resource supplied at construction. The size of buffers obtained
   follows a geometric progression.

   monotonic_buffer_resource is not thread-safe.
