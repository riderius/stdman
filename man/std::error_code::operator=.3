   1) Replaces the error code and corresponding category with those representing error
   code enum e.

   Equivalent to *this = make_error_code(e), where make_error_code is only found by
   argument-dependent lookup.

   This overload participates in overload resolution only if
   std::is_error_code_enum<ErrorCodeEnum>::value is true.
   2,3) Implicitly defined copy-assignment operator and move-assignment operator assign
   the contents of other to *this.

.SH Parameters

   e     - error code enum to construct
   other - another error code to assign with

.SH Return value

   *this
