.SH NAME
std::unordered_multiset::rehash \- std::unordered_multiset::rehash

.SH Synopsis
   void rehash( size_type count );  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Changes the number of buckets to a value n that is not less than count and satisfies
   n >= size() / max_load_factor(), then rehashes the container, i.e. puts the elements
   into appropriate buckets considering that total number of buckets has changed.

.SH Parameters

   count - lower bound for the new number of buckets

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Complexity

   Average case linear in the size of the container, worst case quadratic.

.SH Notes

   rehash\fB(0)\fP may be used to force an unconditional rehash, such as after suspension of
   automatic rehashing by temporarily increasing max_load_factor().
