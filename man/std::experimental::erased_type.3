.SH NAME
std::experimental::erased_type \- std::experimental::erased_type

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/utility>
   struct erased_type { };                   (library fundamentals TS)
                                             (removed in library fundamentals TS v3)

   The class erased_type is an empty struct that serves as a placeholder for a type in
   situations where the actual type is determined at runtime. For example, in classes
   that use type-erased allocators, the nested typedef allocator_type is an alias for
   erased_type.

.SH Notes

   erased_type is removed in LFTS v3 because std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<> is
   preferable for type erasure.
