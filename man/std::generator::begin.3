.SH NAME
std::generator::begin \- std::generator::begin

.SH Synopsis
   /*iterator*/ begin();  (since C++23)

   Pushes coroutine_ into *active_ stack, then evaluates coroutine_.resume().

   Before invocation of begin() the coroutine_ must refer to a coroutine suspended at
   its initial suspend point.

.SH Return value

   An iterator whose coroutine_ member refers to the same coroutine as coroutine_ does.

.SH Notes

   It is an undefined behavior to call begin() more than once on the same generator
   object.
