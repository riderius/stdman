.SH NAME
std::unique_lock::try_lock \- std::unique_lock::try_lock

.SH Synopsis
   bool try_lock();  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Tries to lock (i.e., takes ownership of) the associated mutex without blocking.
   Effectively calls mutex()->try_lock().

   std::system_error is thrown if there is no associated mutex or if the mutex is
   already locked by this std::unique_lock.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   true if the ownership of the mutex has been acquired successfully, false otherwise.

.SH Exceptions

     * Any exceptions thrown by mutex()->try_lock() (Mutex types do not throw in
       try_lock, but a custom Lockable might).
     * If there is no associated mutex, std::system_error with an error code of
       std::errc::operation_not_permitted.
     * If the mutex is already locked by this std::unique_lock, std::system_error with
       an error code of std::errc::resource_deadlock_would_occur.

.SH Example

   The following examples try to acquire a mutex that was locked and unlocked.

   
// Run this code

 #include <chrono>
 #include <iostream>
 #include <mutex>
 #include <thread>
 #include <vector>
  
 using namespace std::chrono_literals;
  
 int main()
 {
     std::mutex counter_mutex;
     std::vector<std::thread> threads;
     using Id = int;
  
     auto worker_task = [&](Id id, std::chrono::seconds wait, std::chrono::seconds acquire)
     {
         // wait for a few seconds before acquiring lock.
         std::this_thread::sleep_for(wait);
  
         std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(counter_mutex, std::defer_lock);
         if (lock.try_lock())
             std::cout << '#' << id << ", lock acquired.\\n";
         else
         {
             std::cout << '#' << id << ", failed acquiring lock.\\n";
             return;
         }
  
         // keep the lock for a while.
         std::this_thread::sleep_for(acquire);
  
         std::cout << '#' << id << ", releasing lock (via destructor).\\n";
     };
  
     threads.emplace_back(worker_task, Id{0}, 0s, 2s);
     threads.emplace_back(worker_task, Id{1}, 1s, 0s);
     threads.emplace_back(worker_task, Id{2}, 3s, 0s);
  
     for (auto& thread : threads)
         thread.join();
 }

.SH Output:

 #0, lock acquired.
 #1, failed acquiring lock.
 #0, releasing lock (via destructor).
 #2, lock acquired.
 #2, releasing lock (via destructor).
