.SH Synopsis
   template< class U >                                      \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   reference_wrapper( U&& x ) noexcept(/*see below*/) ;         (constexpr since C++20)
   reference_wrapper( const reference_wrapper& other )      \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   noexcept;                                                    (constexpr since C++20)

   Constructs a new reference wrapper.

   1) Converts x to T& as if by T& t = std::forward<U>(x);, then stores a reference to
   t. This overload participates in overload resolution only if typename
   std::decay<U>::type is not the same type as reference_wrapper and the expression
   FUN(std::declval<U>()) is well-formed, where FUN names the set of imaginary
   functions

 void FUN(T&) noexcept;
 void FUN(T&&) = delete;

   2) Copy constructor. Stores a reference to other.get().

.SH Parameters

   x     - an object to wrap
   other - another reference wrapper

.SH Exceptions

   1)
   noexcept specification:  
   noexcept(noexcept(FUN(std::declval<U>())))
   where FUN is the set of imaginary functions described in the description above.
