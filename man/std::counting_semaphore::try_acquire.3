.SH NAME
std::counting_semaphore::try_acquire \- std::counting_semaphore::try_acquire

.SH Synopsis
   bool try_acquire() noexcept;  \fI(since C++20)\fP

   Tries to atomically decrement the internal counter by 1 if it is greater than 0; no
   blocking occurs regardless.

.SH Return value

   true if it decremented the internal counter, otherwise false.

.SH Notes

   Implementations are allowed to fail to decrement the counter even if it was greater
   than 0 - i.e., they are allowed to spuriously fail and return false.
