.SH NAME
std::experimental::memory_alignment \- std::experimental::memory_alignment

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/simd>
   template< class T, class U = typename T::value_type >  (parallelism TS v2)
   struct memory_alignment;

   If is_simd_mask_v<T> is true and U is bool, or if is_simd_v<T> is true and U is a
   vectorizable type, provides the member constant value equal to the minimum alignment
   of a pointer passed to a load constructor, copy_from function, or copy_to function.
   For any other types T and U, there is no member value.

   If the program adds specializations for std::memory_alignment
   or std::memory_alignment_v
   \fI(since C++17)\fP, the behavior is undefined.

.SH Member constants

   value    the minimum alignment of a pointer passed to a load constructor, copy_from
   \fB[static]\fP function, or copy_to function
            \fI(public static member constant)\fP

.SH Member functions

   operator std::size_t converts the object to  std::size_t, returns value
