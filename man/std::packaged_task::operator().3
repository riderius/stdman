.SH NAME
std::packaged_task::operator() \- std::packaged_task::operator()

.SH Synopsis
   void operator()( ArgTypes... args );  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Calls the stored task as if by INVOKE<R>(f, args...), where f is the stored task.
   The return value of the task or any exceptions thrown are stored in the shared
   state. The shared state is made ready and any threads waiting for this are
   unblocked.

.SH Parameters

   args - the parameters to pass on invocation of the stored task

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

   std::future_error on the following error conditions:

     * The stored task has already been invoked. The error category is set to
       promise_already_satisfied.
     * *this has no shared state. The error category is set to no_state.
