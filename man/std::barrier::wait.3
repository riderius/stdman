.SH NAME
std::barrier::wait \- std::barrier::wait

.SH Synopsis
   void wait( arrival_token&& arrival ) const;  \fI(since C++20)\fP

   If arrival is associated with the phase synchronization point for the current phase
   of *this, blocks at the synchronization point associated with arrival until the
   phase completion step of the synchronization point's phase is run.

   Otherwise, if arrival is associated with the phase synchronization point for the
   immediately preceding phase of *this, returns immediately.

   Otherwise, i.e. if arrival is associated with the phase synchronization point for an
   earlier phase of *this or any phase of a barrier object other than *this, the
   behavior is undefined.

.SH Parameters

   arrival - an arrival_token obtained by a previous call to arrive on the same barrier

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

   Throws std::system_error with an error code allowed for mutex types on error.
